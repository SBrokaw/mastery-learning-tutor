# Knowledge Graph System Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how the system organizes and connects learning topics to create coherent learning paths and identify prerequisite relationships. The system uses simple markdown-based topic mapping rather than complex graph databases.

## Core Concept

A knowledge graph organizes topics by their relationships and dependencies, enabling the system to:
- Identify what topics to learn next
- Understand prerequisite requirements
- Create logical learning sequences
- Connect related concepts for deeper understanding

## Topic Organization

### Topic Structure
Each topic is defined in a simple markdown file:

```markdown
# Topic: Linear Algebra Fundamentals
**Category**: Mathematics
**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Basic algebra, arithmetic
**Related Topics**: Matrix operations, Vector spaces, Eigenvalues
**Learning Resources**: Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, Practice problems
**Estimated Time**: 20-30 hours
```

### Relationship Types

#### Prerequisites
- Topics that must be mastered before learning this topic
- Example: Calculus requires algebra and trigonometry

#### Related Topics
- Topics that enhance understanding when learned together
- Example: Linear algebra and machine learning algorithms

#### Advanced Applications
- Topics that build upon this foundational knowledge
- Example: Computer graphics builds on linear algebra

## Implementation Approach

### Simple Topic Mapping
- Store topic relationships in markdown files
- Use simple text-based relationship indicators
- Maintain topic hierarchies through file organization

### Learning Path Generation
- Analyze prerequisite chains to create learning sequences
- Identify optimal topic ordering for efficiency
- Flag missing prerequisites before starting new topics

### Task Integration
- Use topic relationships to suggest next learning tasks
- Connect review tasks to related topics
- Identify knowledge gaps through prerequisite analysis

## Success Metrics

### Learning Efficiency
- Reduced time spent on topics due to missing prerequisites
- Improved understanding through logical topic sequencing
- Better retention through connected learning

### User Experience
- Clear learning paths and next steps
- Reduced confusion about what to learn next
- Confidence in learning progression
