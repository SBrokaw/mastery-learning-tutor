# Task Creation Engine Specification

## Overview

The Task Creation Engine generates personalized learning tasks based on career goals, current skills, and learning science principles. Tasks are created as markdown files that can be easily tracked and updated through conversation.

## Core Concept

Instead of building complex software, the system creates simple, actionable task lists that guide users through existing learning resources. Each task is specific, measurable, and tied to career objectives.

## Task Structure

### Basic Task Format
```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]
**Type**: Learning/Practice/Project/Review/Assessment
**Resource**: [Specific resource to use]
**Objective**: [What skill to master]
**Time Estimate**: [Expected duration]
**Prerequisites**: [Required prior knowledge]
**Success Criteria**: [How to demonstrate mastery]
**Review Schedule**: [When to revisit]

## Steps
1. [ ] Step one
2. [ ] Step two
3. [ ] Step three

## Notes
[Additional context, tips, or warnings]

## Progress Updates
### [Date] - [Duration]

```

### Task Types

#### Learning Tasks

#### Project Tasks
- **Purpose**: Build portfolio and demonstrate skills
- **Resources**: Real-world projects, open source contributions

#### Review Tasks
- **Purpose**: Spaced repetition to prevent forgetting
- **Resources**: Previous materials, self-assessment
- **Example**: "Review calculus derivatives (spaced repetition)"

#### Assessment Tasks
- **Purpose**: Validate skill mastery
- **Resources**: Tests, self-evaluation, peer review
- **Example**: "Complete practice interview questions on ML"

## Task Generation Process

### 1. Skill Gap Analysis
```python
def analyze_skill_gaps(current_skills, target_role_requirements):
    """
    Identify skills needed for career transition.
    """
    gaps = {}
    for skill, level in target_role_requirements.items():
        if skill not in current_skills or current_skills[skill] < level:
            gaps[skill] = {
                'required_level': level,
                'current_level': current_skills.get(skill, 0),
                'priority': calculate_priority(skill, target_role_requirements)
            }
    return gaps
```

### 2. Resource Matching
```python
def find_appropriate_resources(skill, level, learning_style):
    """
    Match skills to existing learning resources.
    """
    resources = {
        'mathematics': {
            'mathacademy': 'Comprehensive mastery-based math learning',
            'khan_academy': 'Free video-based math instruction',
            '3blue1brown': 'Visual math explanations'
        },
        'machine_learning': {
            'coursera_ng': 'Andrew Ng\'s ML course',
            'fastai': 'Practical deep learning',
            'papers_with_code': 'Research papers and implementations'
        },
        'hardware_design': {
            'art_of_electronics': 'Comprehensive electronics textbook',
            'fpga_courses': 'FPGA programming courses',
            'vhdl_tutorials': 'Hardware description language tutorials'
        }
    }
    return resources.get(skill, {}).get(level, 'general_resource')
```

### 3. Task Creation
```python
def create_task(skill, resource, objective, prerequisites):
    """
    Generate a specific, actionable task.
    """
    return {
        'title': f"Master {skill} using {resource}",
        'type': 'learning',
        'resource': resource,
        'objective': objective,
        'time_estimate': estimate_time(skill, resource),
        'prerequisites': prerequisites,
        'success_criteria': define_success_criteria(skill),
        'review_schedule': calculate_review_schedule(skill),
        'steps': generate_steps(skill, resource)
    }
```

## Learning Science Integration

### Spaced Repetition Scheduling
- **Initial Review**: 1-2 days after learning
- **Second Review**: 1 week after initial review
- **Third Review**: 1 month after second review
- **Subsequent Reviews**: Increasing intervals based on performance

### Mastery-Based Progression
- Tasks must be completed to satisfaction before advancing
- Success criteria clearly defined for each task
- No time-based progression, only skill-based

### Active Learning Focus
- Tasks emphasize doing over consuming
- Practice problems and projects prioritized
- Immediate feedback and correction built in
