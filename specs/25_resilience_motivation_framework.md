# Resilience and Motivation Framework Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how the system supports users through the psychological challenges of career transitions, including imposter syndrome, setbacks, and maintaining long-term motivation. The system provides strategies for building resilience and sustaining momentum.

## Core Concept

Career transitions are psychologically demanding journeys that require:
- **Mental resilience** to handle setbacks and rejections
- **Sustained motivation** over long periods of learning
- **Confidence building** despite limited experience
- **Stress management** while balancing current job and learning
- **Support systems** to maintain progress through challenges

## Psychological Challenges
