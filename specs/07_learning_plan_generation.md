# Learning Plan Generation Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how the system creates personalized learning plans that adapt to individual progress, preferences, and career goals. The system generates simple markdown-based learning plans rather than complex adaptive algorithms.

## Core Concept

Learning plan generation creates structured, personalized learning sequences that optimize for long-term retention, practical application, and career advancement. Plans adapt based on performance, interests, and changing goals.
