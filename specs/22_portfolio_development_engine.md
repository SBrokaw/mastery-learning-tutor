# Portfolio Development Engine Specification

## Overview

This specification defines how the system guides users to create portfolio projects that demonstrate real-world skills and impress potential employers. The system focuses on projects that showcase both technical ability and practical problem-solving.

## Core Concept

Portfolio projects serve as tangible evidence of skill mastery and career readiness. They should demonstrate:
- **Technical proficiency** in target skills
- **Problem-solving ability** with real-world challenges
- **Project management** and execution skills
- **Communication** and documentation ability
- **Industry relevance** to target roles

## Project Selection Framework

### Project Criteria
Each portfolio project should meet these standards:

```markdown
# Project: ML Hardware Accelerator Design
**Complexity Level**: Advanced
**Technical Skills**: FPGA programming, ML algorithms, digital design
**Business Impact**: 10x performance improvement over CPU
**Demonstrability**: Working prototype with benchmarks
**Industry Relevance**: Directly applicable to ML hardware roles
**Documentation**: Complete design docs, code, and presentation
**Timeline**: 3-4 months
```

### Project Types by Career Path

#### ML Hardware Engineer Portfolio
1. **FPGA-based Neural Network** - Implement CNN on FPGA with real-time inference
2. **Custom ML Accelerator** - Design specialized hardware for specific ML workloads
3. **Hardware-Software Co-design** - Optimize ML pipeline across hardware/software boundary
4. **Performance Analysis Tool** - Create tools for ML hardware performance evaluation

#### ML Computer Science Portfolio
1. **End-to-End ML Pipeline** - Complete system from data to deployed model
2. **Production ML System** - Scalable ML infrastructure with monitoring
3. **Research Implementation** - Reproduce and extend published ML research
4. **ML Tool Development** - Create useful tools for the ML community

### Project Progression Strategy
