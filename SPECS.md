# Mastery Learning Career Coach - System Specifications

## Overview

This document defines the Mastery Learning Career Coach system - a conversational AI that creates personalized task lists and learning plans for career transitions. The system leverages existing learning resources (Math Academy, online courses, books, projects) rather than building new content, focusing on intelligent guidance and task management.

## Core Concept

The system operates as an intelligent career coach that:
1. **Analyzes** your current skills and career goals
2. **Creates** personalized task lists based on learning science
3. **Guides** you through existing learning resources
4. **Tracks** your progress and adjusts recommendations
5. **Provides** accountability and motivation through conversation
6. **Supports** the complete journey from learning to landing the job

## Target User Profile

**Primary User**: Electrical Engineer in Marketing at Tektronix with 8 years experience
**Goal**: Transition to Machine Learning Hardware Design or ML CS roles
**Motivation**: Higher earning potential to support family
**Learning Style**: Prefers mastery-based learning with clear progression

## Learning Science Foundation

The system applies proven learning methodologies from Math Academy:

- **Active Learning**: Focus on problem-solving over passive consumption
- **Spaced Repetition**: Systematic review to prevent forgetting
- **Mastery Learning**: Demonstrate proficiency before advancing
- **Deliberate Practice**: Focused, effortful practice on specific skills
- **Individualized Pacing**: Progress based on ability, not time

- **Prerequisites**: Required prior knowledge
- **Success Criteria**: How to demonstrate mastery
- **Review Schedule**: When to revisit the topic

### Task Types
1. **Learning Tasks**: Complete specific lessons or chapters
2. **Practice Tasks**: Solve problems or complete exercises
3. **Project Tasks**: Build portfolio projects
4. **Review Tasks**: Spaced repetition reviews
5. **Assessment Tasks**: Self-evaluation and testing
6. **Networking Tasks**: Connect with industry professionals
7. **Interview Tasks**: Prepare for technical and behavioral interviews
8. **Application Tasks**: Job search and application activities

### Task Generation Process
1. Analyze current knowledge state
2. Identify next skills to acquire
3. Find appropriate existing resources
4. Create specific, actionable tasks
5. Schedule reviews and assessments
6. Adjust based on progress feedback
