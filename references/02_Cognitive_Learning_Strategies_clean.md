***Summary:** It is a decisive finding in the literature that students learn better when they are actively engaged in learning exercises as opposed to passively consuming educational content. True active learning requires every individual student to be actively engaged on every piece of the material to be learned.*

### Definition and Importance {#definition-and-importance}

It is a common misconception that the fastest way to learn math is by watching videos, attending lectures, reading books, or re-reading notes. This is false. As [hundreds of studies](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111) have shown, [passively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_learning) consuming educational content leads to significantly worse educational outcomes than [**active learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning), where students are actively performing learning exercises (Freeman et al., 2014).

In a passive learning scenario like watching a video, students may believe they are effectively learning if they can understand the video and follow along. However, following along and understanding the video's contents isn't learning, even if students claim that it is. As discussed in [chapter 3](#bookmark=id.1wu7u977826o), learning is a positive change in long-term memory. In order for students to have learned something, they need to be able to consistently reproduce that information and use it to solve problems. None of these things happen when students watch a video, even if they understand it perfectly. The same reasoning applies to attending lectures, reading books, re-reading notes, and all other passive learning techniques.

The superiority of active learning is so robust across subjects and experimental methodologies that a highly-cited [meta-analysis](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111) states, verbatim (Freeman et al., 2014):

*“...\[C\]alls to increase the number of students receiving STEM degrees could be answered, at least in part, by abandoning traditional lecturing in favor of active learning.*  
*…*  
*Given our results, it is reasonable to raise concerns about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in future experiments.”*

[According to](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/04/14/465729968/a-nobel-laureates-education-plea-revolutionize-teaching) Nobel laureate Carl Wieman, lecturing is the educational equivalent of bloodletting (Westervelt, 2016):

*“You let some blood out and go away and they get well. Was it bloodletting that did it, or something else? … You give people lectures, and \[some students\] go away and learn the stuff. But it wasn't that they learned it from lecture – they learned it from homework, from assignments. When we measure how little people learn from an actual lecture, it's just really small.*  
*…*  
*The quality of teaching is not something that university administrators are rewarded for, and correspondingly know or care about … It's like you've got a hospital and you're not bothering to check if your doctors are using antibiotics or bloodletting.”*

Like lecturing, re-reading does not count as active learning either. As Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel (2014, pp.10) [describe](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674729018):

*“The finding that rereading textbooks is often labor in vain ought to send a chill up the spines of educators and learners, because it’s the number one study strategy of most people – including more than 80 percent of college students in some surveys – and is central in what we tell ourselves to do during the hours we dedicate to learning.*

*Rereading has three strikes against it. It is time consuming. It doesn’t result in durable memory. And it often involves a kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content. The hours immersed in rereading can seem like due diligence, but the amount of study time is no measure of mastery.”*

It’s important to realize that true active learning means every individual student is engaged in activity, not just the class as a whole. For instance, although a class-wide discussion might seem like active learning on the surface, it does not immediately follow that each student is active. Often, it is only a proportionally small number of enthusiastic, vocal students who participate in all parts of the discussion and can be considered truly active. Even if the instructor cold-calls on students who have not been participating, most students will only pay attention enough that they won’t look foolish or be embarrassed if called upon.

Moreover, true active learning requires every individual student to be actively engaged on every piece of material to be learned. Divide-and-conquer group projects do not count as fully active learning because each student is only actively learning the material that corresponds to their individual responsibility in the division of labor. The rest of the project, they observe only passively, if at all.

Math Academy’s approach to math education is entirely centered around true active learning – on every single topic in their course, students are solving problems within minutes of starting the lesson (following a minimum effective dose of initial explanation). They spend the vast majority of their time engaged in active problem-solving.

### Case Studies {#case-studies}

#### | Case Study 1: Why Active Learning is Obvious {#|-case-study-1:-why-active-learning-is-obvious}

To get a clear, concrete picture of what active learning entails and why it is so beneficial, it’s helpful to go through a case study in what is perhaps the most familiar setting for active learning: learning a new sport.

Suppose that you want to learn how to play tennis. You go to your local tennis club, where there is a coach who used to play tennis professionally. They offer personal lessons for a pricey $100/hour, but you really want to learn from the best, as efficiently as possible, so you fork over the money for a lesson the following week.

The next week, you show up for your lesson. The coach greets you and begins the hour-long session. It proceeds as follows:

*\[5 minutes\] Coach talks about the beauty of tennis and why it’s a great sport to learn.*

*\[5 minutes\] Coach demonstrates a tennis stance and explains the specific components of the stance: bent knees, forward lean, racket in front of you, etc.*

*\[5 minutes\] Coach demonstrates the ideal place to stand when receiving a volley: near the baseline, in the middle of the court, so that you’re back far enough that your opponent can’t hit the ball behind you, but you’re close enough to the net to launch forward towards any shorter volleys.*

*\[10 minutes\] Coach demonstrates a forehand swing, explains how the force should come from the legs and the twisting of the body (rather than the arm) and emphasizes the importance of “follow through” on the swing.*

*\[20 minutes\] Coach demonstrates a backhand swing, breaks down the components, and shares stories about historic moments in tennis when a player had no time to position themself for a forehand and therefore had to rely on their backhand to win the game. Coach demonstrates a one-arm backhand, an advanced move that looks particularly cool.*

*\[15 minutes\] Coach demonstrates serving and shows off some lightning-fast, precisely targeted serves that seem impossible to return. Again, these are advanced moves that look really cool.*

When the session ends, the coach asks if you want to schedule another session the following week. 

What do you do? Are you a happy customer? Do you want to schedule another session? Heck no\! The coach just waxed philosophical and showed you moves the whole time. You didn’t actually learn anything. You might as well have just watched tennis on TV. You signed up for a tennis lesson to become a better tennis player – not to watch the coach hit the ball. You just wasted $100 on a complete waste of time and you want your money back.

Of course, this situation is unlikely to occur in real life athletic training because coaches know that continued employment depends on their ability to make students learn. They are held accountable for improving the performance of their students. They need to get real, demonstrable results, and get them fast – and if they can’t, then they’re going to lose a client and develop a reputation as a grifter who tricks people into paying a lot of money for a service that just doesn’t work.

In real life athletic training, a coach is going to have their students actively performing moves within the first couple minutes of the session. Sure, the coach might take a minute to demonstrate and break down a new move as the student watches, but for the next 10+ minutes after that, the student is going to be actively practicing that new move. The coach will observe the student and point out areas where they need to correct their form to be more effective – and as the student gets better at the new move, they will experience a real, demonstrable improvement in their athletic performance. Maybe they’ll be able to hit the ball faster or more precisely. Maybe they’ll be able to return a tricky volley that originally kept going past them at the beginning of the session. Whatever the improvement, it will be tangible and reproducible.

It’s worth emphasizing: in a personal coaching session, when does the learning occur? It’s not when you pay the coach the money. It’s not when you watch the coach demonstrate a move. It’s when you actually start doing things that you weren’t able to do before. It’s when you attempt a move, the coach corrects your form, and you attempt the move again with better results. The learning is the incremental gain in your ability to perform a skill. If you’re not getting those gains, you’re not learning.

The same reasoning applies if you’re getting a lesson on piano or guitar. You’re not just absorbing information – you’re developing skills. Mathematics, too, is skill-based. Learning how to solve a new type of equation is totally different from, say, learning some new history about the life of Napoleon. At the core, the keys to effective training in mathematics are the same as the keys to effective training in athletics or music.

#### | Case Study 2: Most Students Don’t Even Pay Attention During Lectures {#|-case-study-2:-most-students-don’t-even-pay-attention-during-lectures}

As he details in an [interview](https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/peter-reinhardt-on-finding-product-market-fit-at-segment/), Peter Reinhardt, co-founder and CEO of the customer data platform Segment, learned the hard way that most students aren’t even paying attention during lecture (Y Combinator, 2018).

According to Reinhardt, Segment’s original product was actually a classroom lecture tool:

*“The idea was to give students this button to push to say, “I’m confused.” The professor would get this graph over time of how confused the students were. We thought it was a really cool idea. We were college students at the time and we had a bunch of professors who were excited about it at MIT and elsewhere. … \[W\]e talked to like 20 other professors and they were all excited about it.”*

However, despite all the excitement from professors, when testing the tool in an actual classroom at Boston University, it was a total disaster – not because the tool didn’t work, but because the students weren’t even paying attention to what the professor was saying.

Instead, most students were either partially or fully engrossed with scrolling through Facebook. The lecture was, effectively, just a charade: the students weren’t even passively learning; they were just sitting there doing other stuff.

*“It was just a total disaster. All the students opened their laptops and they all went straight to Facebook.*

*The way we discovered this is we were standing in the black of the classroom and just counting laptop screens. We’d be looking over the shoulders of the students and going one, two, three and we discovered at the beginning of class, about 60% of the students were on Facebook and by the end about 80% were on Facebook. Oh my God.*  
*…*  
*Standing in the back of a BU classroom. It was an anthropology class. And I remember arriving at the 60% and the 80% and we went up and apologized to the professor and walked out.”*

The situation seemed so hopeless that – despite having gone through a months-long startup incubator program, building out a highly sophisticated product consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and raising over half a million dollars in investments literally a week before – they completely abandoned the product and called up their investors to return the investment money.

*“We went through the whole YC \[Y Combinator startup incubator\] with this idea. Built it out. Hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Super-complicated classroom lecture tool product. It had presentation view and people could ask questions. It was very complicated. We actually even raised money at Demo Day with this idea. About \[$\]600K.*  
*…*  
*We had just gotten wires for these checks, for this money, literally a week before. We called back all the investors and we were like, ‘Well, it turns out this is a terrible idea. So what do you want us to do with the money?’ Almost all of them said, well, we invested for the team so go find something else.”*

As fate would have it, most of the investors were willing to retain the investment if the team pivoted to solving a more promising problem – so the team pivoted to building a web analytics tool that would help other developers avoid this kind of catastrophe by getting a better understanding of how users were behaving on their apps.

*“We realized, we should have been able to figure out some of this analysis by not just standing in the back of the classroom. Like, we should have been able to see some of this digitally. You couldn’t see it in the analytics metrics at all. We decided, hey, let’s build an analytics tool.”*

#### | Case Study 3: How Active Learning Saved MIT’s Physics Classes {#|-case-study-3:-how-active-learning-saved-mit’s-physics-classes}

In the early 2000s, MIT solved issues with its physics courses by switching from passive to active learning. The problem, [according](https://web.mit.edu/edtech/casestudies/pdf/teal1.pdf) to John Belcher, the MIT professor who spearheaded the effort, was that a staggering number of undergraduates were failing their freshman (first-year) physics course, a general education requirement (Dori & Belcher, 2005):

*“Teaching freshman courses in a large lecture hall with over 300 students … is based on the assumption that the instructor can ‘pour out’ knowledge from his or her vast reservoir into the empty glasses of the students’ minds.*  
*…*  
*If this were true, students at MIT would not fail these large required classes. The high failure rates in these courses at MIT, approaching 15%, and the low attendance in lectures at the end of the term, less than 50%, suggest that there is a basic flaw in this model of instruction.”*

Keep in mind that MIT is one of the most selective universities in the world, known especially for admitting students with extremely high mathematical capabilities and passion for quantitative subjects like physics. With a yearly cohort of about 1000 students, a 15% failure rate means that, roughly, a staggering 150 MIT students were failing those courses each year. If this many highly-qualified MIT admits are failing a first-year general education requirement, then clearly the problem lies in the delivery of the course, not the ability of the students.

The problem, as Belcher and colleagues characterized it, was that the physics courses were centered around passive learning. The solution, then, would be to switch the courses over to active learning instead (Dori & Belcher, 2005).

*“The thinking required while attending a lecture is low-level comprehension of factual knowledge that goes from the ear to the writing hand (Towns & Grant, 1997). Johnson et al. (1998) pointed out that students’ attention to what the instructor was saying decreased as the lecture proceeded. … As Bybee and Ben-Zvi (1998) indicated, science educators have focused primarily on content and secondarily on instruction, leaving assessment and implementations to others or completely ignoring them.*

*Until the early 1990’s, most physics instructors were largely unaware of the outcomes of research in physics education (Laws, Rosborough & Poodry, 1999). During the past 15 years, a number of physics curricula have been developed that utilize educational research outcomes. … The common thread in all these curricula is that they emphasize elements of active learning and conceptual understanding that build on making predictions, and observing and discussing the outcomes with peers. Hake (1998) showed that the learning gains in undergraduate physics are almost double when active learning is involved.”*

The movement of these MIT physics courses from passive lectures to active learning classrooms came to be known as the Technology Enhanced Active-Learning (TEAL) project, where TEAL classes operated as follows:

*“A typical \[TEAL\] class is comprised of mini lectures scattered throughout the class, separated by periods in which students are engaged in hands-on desktop experiments, visualizations, problem solving, and peer discussion.”*

Indeed, Belcher and colleagues reported astounding results, with active learning reducing the failure rate by nearly two-thirds:

*“The failure rates in the two experimental groups were less than 5% in the small- and large-scale experimental groups, respectively, compared with 13% in the traditional control group (Spring 2002).”*

In a cohort of 1000 students, this would mean that, of the 130 students who would fail the passive learning class, only 50 would still fail the active learning class, and the other 70 would be rescued from failure and end up passing the class.

#### | Case Study 4: If You’re Active Half the Time, That’s Still Not Enough {#|-case-study-4:-if-you’re-active-half-the-time,-that’s-still-not-enough}

In a [study](https://books.google.com/books?id=gl8nqUjyXWUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) (Deakin & Cobley, 2003, pp.115-136) of figure skaters who had been practicing for a similar number of years, the proportion of active practice (relative to passive practice) was a defining attribute separating the elite and non-elite skaters. The elite skaters spent a greater proportion of their practice time actively practicing some of the trickiest, most taxing moves (jumps & spins), and even when resting from those taxing activities, they were more likely to continue actively practicing less taxing movements like footwork and arm positions.

The authors note specific percentage breakdowns, which we have organized into a table to illustrate how each group of skaters would use 100 minutes of practice time.

*“...\[T\]he elite group spent an average of 14% of their total on-ice practice time on rest; the competitive group, 31%; and the test skaters, 46%. … The elite and competitive skaters spent 68% and 59% of their sessions practicing jumps whereas the test group was engaged in those activities for only 48% of their on-ice time.*  
*…*  
*Not only did the elite group practice jumps and spins for a higher proportion of on-ice session, but they also rested less and used the remaining 18% of their on-ice time to practice other elements of their programs, such as footwork and arm positions.”*

| Group | Active Minutes (= Taxing \+ Non-Taxing) | Passive Minutes | Active Minutesper Passive Minute |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *Elite* | 86   (= 68 \+ 18\) | 14 | 6.1 |
| *Competitive Non-Elite* | 69   (= 59 \+ 10\) | 31 | 2.2 |
| *Non-Competitive* | 54   (= 48 \+ 06\) | 46 | 1.2 |

In the table, we see that the elite skaters allocated their practice time far more efficiently: during practice, the elite skaters were over 6 times more active than passive, while non-competitive skaters were nearly as passive as they were active.

The key takeaway is that, while some amount of active learning is certainly better than no active learning, the best outcomes are achieved by fully maximizing the amount of productive active learning. (Of course, some passive instruction will generally be needed to demonstrate to a learner what it is that they need to practice, but that passive instruction should be kept to a minimum effective dose before launching into more extensive active learning.)

If we ballpark-estimate the proportion of time that a Math Academy student spends on active learning, we get a similar proportion as the elite skaters. On average, a typical Math Academy lesson might consist of 3 worked examples, each followed by about 3 practice questions (give or take depending on how well the student does), and the lesson followed by several explicit reviews (about 4 questions each, again give or take depending on performance) spaced into the future. So, for every 3 worked examples that a student reads, they will be actively doing about 3 × 3 \+ 3 × 4 \= 21 practice problems, putting the net ratio at about 7 active practice problems per passive worked example.

### Neuroscience of Active Learning {#neuroscience-of-active-learning}

The effects of active learning can be seen quite literally in the brain: in brain imaging studies, active learning consistently leads to more neural activation than passive learning.

For instance, in a [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00567/full?amp=1) of students actively writing letters versus passively viewing them, the active writing produced higher brain activity in the sensori-motor network and beyond (Kersey & James, 2013):

*“Self-generated production of cursive letters during learning led to the recruitment of a sensori-motor network known to also be active during letter perception and reading, however, passive observation of a letter being formed did not. This finding adds to the growing literature suggesting that self-generated writing is important for setting up reading networks in the developing brain.*  
*…*  
*Further, when we directly compared active to passive learning of cursive letters, greater recruitment of the bilateral insula and claustrum was shown during the perception of actively learned letters than passively learned letters … \[This would suggest that\] children were better able to phonologically process letters that they learned by writing than those that they learned by observing an experimenter write … \[and that\] writing practice has led to more similar neural representation between printed letters and those letters learned by writing.”*

Not only does active performance produce more physical brain activity than passive viewing, as described above, but researchers have also found that prior active performance can lead to higher brain activity even during passive viewing later on, in a sense “carrying over” to make the passive viewing more active within the brain.

Specifically, Calvo-Merino et al. (2006) [demonstrated](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822\(06\)01998-1.pdf) that when someone views another person performing an action, the viewer experiences higher activation in motor areas if they have frequently performed that action themself:

*“We found greater premotor, parietal, and cerebellar activity when dancers viewed moves from their own motor repertoire, compared to opposite-gender moves that they frequently saw but did not perform.”*

The same researchers elaborated more in an earlier [paper](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/15/8/1243/304707) (Calvo-Merino et al., 2005):

*“Comparing the brain activity when dancers watched their own dance style versus the other style therefore reveals the influence of motor expertise on action observation.*

*We found greater bilateral activations in premotor cortex and intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobe and left posterior superior temporal sulcus when expert dancers viewed movements that they had been trained to perform compared to movements they had not.*

*Our results show that this ‘mirror system’ integrates observed actions of others with an individual's personal motor repertoire, and suggest that the human brain understands actions by motor simulation.”*

### Persistence of Misconceptions {#persistence-of-misconceptions}

Why do misconceptions about active and passive learning persist, despite clear intuition and decisive evidence supporting active learning? Several reasons are obvious:

1. Passive learning is more convenient for students and teachers alike. Teachers don’t have to spend time and effort implementing learning activities, and students don’t have to spend time and effort engaging those activities. Most teachers are happy to lecture about the beautiful intricacies of their field of study and believe that their students are learning, and most students are happy to lean back, relax, pay half attention (if that), and believe that they are learning. (In general, it is always tempting to believe that which is most convenient.)

2. It’s easy to mistakenly believe that you have learned a concept well enough to reason and solve problems when you are not actually made to attempt those things. (For the same reason, many people mistakenly believe that they can outrun a bear.)

3. Some teachers resist active learning methods like cold-calling out of fear that it will make students uncomfortable – even though research has [shown](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elise-Dallimore/publication/258153531_Impact_of_Cold-Calling_on_Student_Voluntary_Participation/links/02e7e536a25071b4f9000000/Impact-of-Cold-Calling-on-Student-Voluntary-Participation.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&origin=journalDetail) that cold-calling not only heightens engagement but also increases voluntary participation and comfort over time (Dallimore, Hertenstein, & Platt, 2013).

A fourth, less-obvious reason was discovered by a [study](https://www.pnas.org/cji/doi/10.1073/pnas.1821936116) (Deslauriers et al., 2019\) on Harvard physics classes, which not only measured educational outcomes in active versus passive learning settings, but also measured students’ *perceptions* of their learning. As quoted in the study:

*“Compared with students in traditional lectures, students in active classes perceived that they learned less, while in reality they learned more.*

*Students rated the quality of instruction in passive lectures more highly, and they expressed a preference to have ‘all of their physics classes taught this way,’ even though their scores on independent tests of learning were lower than those in actively taught classrooms.*  
*…*  
*When students experienced confusion and increased cognitive effort associated with active learning, they perceived this disfluency as a signal of poor learning, while in fact the opposite is true.”*

In other words, active learning produced more learning by increasing cognitive activation, but students *mistakenly* interpreted that extra cognitive effort as an indication that they were not learning as well, when in fact the opposite is true. Active learning creates a [**desirable difficulty**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirable_difficulty) that makes class feel more challenging but improves learning. Passive learning, on the other hand, promotes an **illusion of competence** in which students (and their teachers) overestimate their knowledge because they are not made to exercise it.

That said, it’s dubious whether students and teachers – at their core – truly believe these misconceptions, given that their behavior quickly changes to an active learning model of working through practice questions with direct and immediate feedback when they are held accountable for demonstrating learning, such as when preparing for a standardized test like an AP exam.

In a similar way, one might question whether students – at their core – actually dislike active learning. Tharayil et al. (2018) [note](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40594-018-0102-y) that students’ perceptions of active learning have not been consistent across studies and are often positive:

*“Although much of the published literature suggests that students often respond positively to active learning strategies (Arce 1994; Armbruster et al. 2009; Carlson and Winquist 2011; Hoffman 2001; Leckie 2001; Oakley et al. 2007; O’Brocta and Swigart 2013; Reddy 2000; Richardson and Birge 1995), there are counterbalancing studies which show mixed student responses (Bacon et al. 1999; Brent and Felder 2009; Goodwin et al. 1991; Hall et al. 2002; Kvam 2000; Rangachari 1991; Wilke 2003\) or negative student responses (Lake 2001; Yadav et al. 2011).”*

People often do not look forward to workouts, yet they don’t mind it once they actually begin exercising, and then they feel proud of their efforts afterwards. If active learning is similar to physical activity, then students may prefer passive to active learning simply because it’s easier (a typical human behavior), but they may feel much more engaged during active learning (whereas passive learning is pretty boring for students), and they may feel better about themselves after doing actual work and knowing that they made real progress.

### Active Learning Should Not Imply Unguided Learning or Group Work {#active-learning-should-not-imply-unguided-learning-or-group-work}

A common misconception about active learning is that it must be unguided – the instructor no longer directly communicates the information to be learned, but rather, sets up a group learning experience where students are expected to discover the information themselves with minimal guidance. However, this is not the only form, or even the optimal form, of active learning. While unguided learning and group work typically suffer from serious pedagogical shortcomings detailed in [Chapter 8](#bookmark=id.hzqmmfd5p3yu), 	active learning is perfectly compatible with **direct instruction**, where all information to be learned is explicitly communicated and all active practice is performed with corrective feedback and guidance. Ideally, over the course of a learning session, students will complete numerous cycles rapidly alternating between minimum effective doses of guided instruction and active practice.

Misconceptions about active learning are furthered by misinterpretations of research results: while there do exist studies where active learning with minimal guidance has outperformed passive learning with direct instruction, such experiments are often misinterpreted by the lay audience as providing support for minimal guidance. It’s easy to understand why such misinterpretations are tempting: minimal guidance is sometimes a part of the more successful experimental condition. However, this does not imply that minimal guidance is desirable.

As discussed in [Chapter 10](#bookmark=id.1al4cded0jxy), active learning is superior to passive learning: students who spend a class period actively solving problems, hands-on, learn more than students who sit and passively listen to a lecture without actively practicing the material. Active learning is so superior to passive learning that any experimental condition involving active learning will likely outperform any experimental condition involving passive learning, no matter what other second-order strategies are tacked on\! One could take tired students, engage them in active learning, and probably get a better learning outcome than well-rested students experiencing passive learning. But does that mean being tired is good for learning? No\!

Even if a study finds that active learning with minimal guidance outperforms passive learning with direct instruction, one cannot conclude that minimal guidance is superior to direct instruction. In general, if two variables are changed at once to yield a superior outcome, no conclusion can be reached about either of the individual variables. All that can be concluded is that one combination is superior to the other combination. In the case of minimal guidance versus direct instruction, it turns out that when both are paired with active learning, direct instruction outperforms minimal guidance. Here is the big picture, in terms of learning outcomes:

Active and Direct \> Active and Unguided \> Passive and Direct

(“Passive and Unguided” is not included above because it’s unclear whether such a combination is even possible to implement.)

## Chapter 12\. Deliberate Practice {#chapter-12.-deliberate-practice}

***Summary:** Deliberate practice is the most effective form of active learning. It consists of individualized training activities specially chosen to improve specific aspects of a student’s performance through repetition and successive refinement. It is mindful repetition at the edge of one’s ability, the opposite of mindless repetition within one’s repertoire. The amount of deliberate practice has been shown to be one of the most prominent underlying factors responsible for individual differences in performance across numerous fields, even among highly talented elite performers. Deliberate practice demands effort and intensity, and may be discomforting, but its long-term commitment compounds incremental improvements, leading to expertise.*

### Definition and Importance {#definition-and-importance-1}

#### | Deliberate vs Non-Deliberate Practice {#|-deliberate-vs-non-deliberate-practice}

While active learning leads to significantly better educational outcomes than passive learning, not all active learning strategies are created equal. The most effective type of active learning is [**deliberate practice**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_\(learning_method\)#Deliberate_practice), which consists of individualized training activities specially chosen to improve specific aspects of a student’s performance through repetition and successive refinement.

Deliberate practice is mindful repetition at the edge of one’s ability, the opposite of mindless repetition within one’s repertoire, and it has been [shown](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice\(PsychologicalReview\).pdf) to be one of the most prominent underlying factors responsible for individual differences in performance, even among highly talented elite performers (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993). K. Anders Ericsson, first author of that study and one of the most influential researchers in the field of human expertise and performance, [elaborates](https://clinica.ispa.pt/ficheiros/areas_utilizador/user11/4_-_the_influence_of_experience_and_deliberate_practice_on_the_development_of_superior_expert_performance.pdf) further on what it means to engage in deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2006):

*“The core assumption of deliberate practice (Ericsson, 1996, 2002, 2004; Ericsson et al., 1993\) is that expert performance is acquired gradually and that effective improvement of performance requires the opportunity to find suitable training tasks that the performer can master sequentially – typically the design of training tasks and monitoring of the attained performance is done by a teacher or a coach.*

*Deliberate practice presents performers with tasks that are initially outside their current realm of reliable performance, yet can be mastered within hours of practice by concentrating on critical aspects and by gradually refining performance through repetitions after feedback.* 

*Hence, the requirement for concentration sets deliberate practice apart from both mindless, routine performance and playful engagement, as the latter two types of activities would, if anything, merely strengthen the current mediating cognitive mechanisms rather than modify them to allow increases in the level of performance.”*

Ericsson [offers](https://nibmehub.com/opac-service/pdf/read/The%20Psychology%20of%20Problem%20Solving.pdf#page=86) (2003, pp.72-73) a concrete and familiar example illustrating the distinction between deliberate and non-deliberate practice in the context of music:

*“As children, many people may have spent a lot of time practicing the piano with modest improvements, or known other people who did. When parents forced them to practice, many piano students would simply play the same piece repeatedly without full concentration on specific aspects of their performance. Under those circumstances the existing performance level becomes only more stable and ‘practice’ makes it permanent. The relation between current level of performance and the number of hours of ‘practice’ is weak for this type of beginner (Lehmann, 1997).* 

*Successful practice requires identifying specific goals for how to change the performance. … Most deliberate practice by music students is solitary as they attempt to master specific assignments, often new pieces of music selected by their teachers to be of an appropriate difficulty level. Musicians will encounter difficult passages while mastering a new piece of music. To achieve mastery, the musician first identifies the source of the problem, often by playing the passage in a slow tempo. … With focused repetitions the pianist will generally reach mastery.*

*Sometimes the pianist will still experience difficulties and work on specific exercises that eventually lead to desired changes. In music, there is a large body of training techniques that have been designed to help musicians develop control over performance and attain the desired speed and dexterity. The use of techniques designed to overcome weaknesses and increase control exemplifies the essence of deliberate practice.”*

Below is another example, also [offered](https://www.academia.edu/download/54133889/Why_study_time_does_not_predict_grade_po20170813-2588-hxvq2s.pdf) by Ericsson and colleagues, illustrating deliberate practice the context of athletics (Plant et al., 2005):

*“...\[M\]any people know recreational golf and tennis players whose performance has not improved in spite of 20–30 years of active participation. The mere act of regularly engaging in an activity for years and even decades does not appear to lead to improvements in performance, once an acceptable level of performance has been attained (Ericsson, 2002).* 

*For example, if someone misses a backhand volley during a tennis game, there may be a long time before the same person gets another chance at that same type of shot. When the chance finally comes, they are not prepared and are likely to miss a similar shot again. In contrast, a tennis coach can give tennis players repeated opportunities to hit backhand volleys that are progressively more challenging and eventually integrated into representative match play.*

*However, unlike recreational play, such deliberate practice requires high levels of concentration with few outside distractions and is not typically spontaneous but carefully scheduled (Ericsson, 1996, 2002). A tennis player who takes advantage of this instruction and then engages in particular practice activities recommended by the teacher for a couple of hours in deeply focused manner (deliberate practice), may improve specific aspects of his or her game more than he or she otherwise might experience after many years of recreational play.”*

#### | Deliberate Practice is Effective, Non-Deliberate Practice is Not {#|-deliberate-practice-is-effective,-non-deliberate-practice-is-not}

It’s important to realize that the effects of deliberate practice hold across a wide variety of domains, not just music and athletics. As [summarized](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/c8cc4a4f-e641-462b-9a72-654e60f71485/content) by Reeves (2014):

*“Since the original presentation of deliberate practice, the theory has been tested and applied to a number of domains. Ericsson originally speculated that deliberate practice would be of particular value in domains such as: chess, sports, mathematics, and sciences (Ericsson 1993). He has personally investigated a number of these domains and their relationship to deliberate practice. Domains in which he found significant evidence of deliberate practice being a predictor of elite level of expertise include: problem-solving, dart throwing, rhythmic gymnastics, golf, education, nursing, medical expertise, interpreting, and golf (Ericsson 1993, Ericsson 2000a, Ericsson 2000b, Ericsson 2007a, Ericsson 2007b, Ericsson 2007c, Ericsson 2008a, Ericsson 2008b).*

*Additionally, other academicians have taken this theory and successfully applied it to other domains as well. Most recently, deliberate practice was found to be an effective tool for enhancing microsurgical skills in surgeons (El Tecle 2013\) as well as hysteroscopy skills in obstetrics and gynecology residents (Rackow 2012). Outside of medicine, deliberate practice has been shown to be significant in accelerating a wide variety of other skills, including: knowledge development (Pachman 2013), critical thinking skills (Cahill 2012), team sports (Helson 1998), chess (Charness 2005), and advanced writing skills (Kellogg 2009\) among others.”*

The effectiveness of deliberate practice, and the ineffectiveness of non-deliberate practice, is so strong that metrics of professional experience that combine the two (such as “years of experience”) have been found to only weakly predict actual performance – whereas, on its own, the amount of purely deliberate practice is a much stronger predictor. As [summarized](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00227.x) by Ericsson (2008):

*“Traditionally, professional expertise has been judged by length of experience, reputation, and perceived mastery of knowledge and skill. Unfortunately, recent research demonstrates only a weak relationship between these indicators of expertise and actual, observed performance. In fact, observed performance does not necessarily correlate with greater professional experience.*

*Expert performance can, however, be traced to active engagement in deliberate practice (DP), where training (often designed and arranged by their teachers and coaches) is focused on improving particular tasks. DP also involves the provision of immediate feedback, time for problem-solving and evaluation, and opportunities for repeated performance to refine behavior.”*

Along these lines, Lehtinen et al. (2017) [emphasize](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jake-Mcmullen/publication/317035771_Cultivating_mathematical_skills_From_drill-and-practice_to_deliberate_practice/links/6192129bd7d1af224bef75bb/Cultivating-mathematical-skills-From-drill-and-practice-to-deliberate-practice.pdf) that in the context of academics in particular, quantity of study time is not by itself a strong predictor of academic improvement – rather, the *quality* of study time is the critical determinant.

*“It is important to note that it is ‘deliberate’ practice that matters, not just any practice. For example, Plant, Ericsson, Hill, and Asberg (2005) found that improvement in performance in higher education did not significantly correlate with the amount of time spent studying. It did, however, relate to concentrated learning aimed at specific performance goals.”*

Furthermore, Debatin et al. (2023) [note](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-021-02326-x) that high-quality deliberate practice requires complete individualization, an aspect that is sometimes overlooked even by academics in the field:

*“...\[Some\] authors have neglected the most important characteristic of deliberate practice: individualization of practice. Many of the analyzed effect sizes derived from measures that did not assess individualized practice and, therefore, should not have been included in meta-analyses of deliberate practice.*  
*…*  
*In our study of 178 chess players, we found that at a high level of individualization and quality of practice, the effect size of structured practice was more than three times higher than that found at the average level.”*

Intuitively, the specific aspects of performance that one student is most in need of refining will generally be different for another student, meaning that the most effective exercises on which to spend practice time will differ from student to student.

### Effort is Required {#effort-is-required}

#### | Deliberate Practice Feels Like Exercising with a Personal Trainer {#|-deliberate-practice-feels-like-exercising-with-a-personal-trainer}

On Math Academy, students spend the entirety of their time engaged in deliberate practice by solving problems (and receiving feedback) on new topics and topics most in need of review. We intersperse active problem-solving with instruction so that students receive minimum effective doses of information right before they use it to actively solve problems and receive feedback.

In this way, learning on Math Academy feels like exercising with a personal trainer:

1. The trainer quickly demonstrates an exercise, which you observe.

2. You attempt the exercise, and the trainer corrects anything that is wrong with your form. 

3. You continue practicing the exercise, receiving feedback from the trainer, until you are able to complete it comfortably with proper form.

4. The trainer introduces you to a more challenging exercise, and you go back to step 1\.

![][image25]

Like exercise with a personal trainer, learning with Math Academy requires effort. Building neural connections takes work, just like building muscle. We will challenge you, but we will not ask you to do anything that you’re unprepared for.

#### | Cycle of Strain and Adaptation {#|-cycle-of-strain-and-adaptation}

As Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer (1993) [describe](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice\(PsychologicalReview\).pdf), deliberate practice requires intense, near-maximal-effort training. The goal is to push the limit of one’s performance capacity forward during each practice session.

*“Deliberate practice aimed at improving strength and endurance in sports clearly shows the importance of near maximal effort during practice and the resulting fatigue. Physical activity and exercise produce no benefit unless they are sufficiently intense … elite athletes train at much higher intensities to improve their performance.”*

This creates a continual cycle of strain and adaptation. As Ericsson (2006) [elaborates](https://clinica.ispa.pt/ficheiros/areas_utilizador/user11/4_-_the_influence_of_experience_and_deliberate_practice_on_the_development_of_superior_expert_performance.pdf):

*“Measurable increases in physical fitness do not simply result from wishful thinking. Instead people have to engage in intense aerobic exercise that pushes them well beyond the level of comfortable physical activity if they are to improve their aerobic fitness (Ericsson, 2003a; Ericsson et al., 1993; Robergs & Roberts, 1997).*  
*…*  
*When the human body is put under exceptional strain, a range of dormant genes in the DNA are expressed and extraordinary physiological processes are activated. Over time the cells of the body, including the brain (see Hill & Schneider, Chapter 37\) will reorganize in response to the induced metabolic demands of the activity by, for example, increases in the number of capillaries supplying blood to muscles and changes in metabolism of the muscle fibers themselves.*

*These adaptations will eventually allow the individual to execute the given level of activity without greatly straining the physiological systems. To gain further beneficial increases in adaptation, the athletes need to increase or change their weekly training activities to induce new and perhaps different types of strain on the key physiological systems.”* 

Even in contexts outside of sports, these adaptations can be detected as physical changes in the brain:

*“...\[A\]thletic training involves pushing the associated physiological systems outside the comfort zone to stimulate physiological growth and adaptation (Ericsson, 2001, 2002, 2003a, 2003c, 2003d). Furthermore, recent reviews (Gaser & Schlaug, 2003; Hill & Schneider, Chapter 37; Kolb & Whishaw, 1998\) show that the function and structure of the brain is far more adaptable than previously thought possible.*

*Especially, early and extended training has shown to change the cortical mapping of musicians (Elbert, Pantev, Wienbruch, Rockstoh, & Taub, 1995), the development of white matter in the brain (Bengtsson et al., 2005), the development of “turn out” of ballet dancers, the development of perfect pitch, and flexibility of fingers (Ericsson & Lehmann, 1996).*

*In sum, elite performers search continuously for optimal training activities, with the most effective duration and intensity, that will appropriately strain the targeted physiological system to induce further adaptation without causing overuse and injury.”*

### Discomfort is Required {#discomfort-is-required}

Deliberate practice requires repeatedly practicing skills that are *beyond* one’s repertoire. However, this tends to be more effortful and less enjoyable, which can mislead non-experts to practice within their level of comfort.

For instance, this was [observed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24001022/) as a factor differentiating intermediate and expert Gaeilic football players (Coughlan et al., 2014):

*“Expert and intermediate level Gaelic football players executed two types of kicks during an acquisition phase and pre-, post-, and retention tests. During acquisition, participants self-selected how they practiced and rated the characteristics of deliberate practice for effort and enjoyment.*

*The expert group predominantly practiced the skill they were weaker at and improved its performance across pre-, post- and retention tests. Participants in the expert group also rated their practice as more effortful and less enjoyable compared to those in the intermediate group.*

*In contrast, participants in the intermediate group predominantly practiced the skill they were stronger at and improved their performance from pretest to posttest but not on the retention test.”*

Likewise, as [described](https://clinica.ispa.pt/ficheiros/areas_utilizador/user11/4_-_the_influence_of_experience_and_deliberate_practice_on_the_development_of_superior_expert_performance.pdf) by Ericsson (2006) in the context of singing:

*“In a recent study of singers Grape, Sandgren, Hansson, Ericsson, and Theorell (2003) revealed reliable differences of skill in the level of physiological and psychological indicators of concentration and effort during a singing lesson.*

*Whereas the amateur singers experienced the lesson as self-actualization and an enjoyable release of tension, the professional singers increased their concentration and focused on improving their performance during the lesson.”*

And as Lehtinen et al. (2017) [elaborate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jake-Mcmullen/publication/317035771_Cultivating_mathematical_skills_From_drill-and-practice_to_deliberate_practice/links/6192129bd7d1af224bef75bb/Cultivating-mathematical-skills-From-drill-and-practice-to-deliberate-practice.pdf):

*“The ‘art of deliberate practice’ obviously includes the ability and willingness to conduct highly concentrated activities which might be, to some degree, aversive in nature. For example, maximal capacity training in running is demanding and situationally unpleasant even for world-class runners, but it is undeniably a necessary part of running training.*   
*…*  
*However, less experienced individuals like novices tend to focus their practice on more pleasant levels of effort. For example, unexperienced musicians often practice pieces (or parts of pieces) which they have already mastered. They try to avoid errors and failures and they do not challenge their own learning. It is in response to this that trainers/mentors/guides etc. are most valuable.*  
*…*  
*In the realm of mathematics education, a distinction should also be made between routine practice with existing skills and the types of deliberate practice that push students to develop their emerging skills and knowledge structures. … In geometry learning, Pachman, Sweller, and Kalyuga (2013) … found that more knowledgeable students even tended to choose achievable rather than difficult problems if they had the opportunity to choose. Training with these geometrical tasks resulted in minimal performance improvements. Only when a deliberate practice model was applied and these more knowledgeable students were presented with designer-selected difficult problems to solve did their skills improve.”*

It’s a common misconception that maximum-efficiency learning should feel maximally scaffolded, perfectly smooth and easy the whole way through. While this is more true than not, it misses an important nuance: maximum-efficiency learning should feel just-enough scaffolded that the learning tasks are challenging yet still achievable.

This is more obvious in the context of athletics: maximum-efficiency training involves pushing athletes to the brink of their capabilities. At the beginning of a training session, an athlete undergoing maximal-efficiency training will probably not be confident in their ability to successfully perform the training tasks, but they will end up doing so.

![][image26]

When you’re developing skills at peak efficiency, you are maximizing the difficulty of your training tasks subject to the constraint that you end up successfully overcoming those difficulties in a timely manner. A noteworthy corollary is that you are also *minimizing* your confidence in your ability to complete the training tasks (again subject to the constraint that you end up successfully completing them in a timely manner).

In that view, confidence is more of a “hindsight” thing than an “in-the-moment” thing. If you feel confident while engaging in maximum-efficiency learning, it’s not because the task in front of you seems easy relative to your abilities, but because you’ve been in situations before where tasks felt challenging relative to your abilities but you’ve always managed to come out successful.

One can also gain confidence by looking at progress over time. While the amount of progress over any single training session may feel small, consistent deliberate practice will lead to large performance gains over longer periods of time. When a student looks at training activities from months ago (e.g., math problems that felt hard at the time), and these activities now feel much easier than the student remembered, this can provide a large confidence boost.

### Long-Term Compounding {#long-term-compounding}

#### | Expertise is the Product of Incremental Improvements Over Time {#|-expertise-is-the-product-of-incremental-improvements-over-time}

Lehtinen et al. (2017) are careful to note that a single round of deliberate practice will not result in instant expertise – rather, it is the compounding of these incremental improvements over a longer period of time that lead someone to become an expert:

*“The formation of expert-like practice activities is not a single event, but a long process in itself. The acquisition of high level competence in complex domains such as mathematics is a laborious process that needs deliberate practice during a number of years.”*

Anderson, Reder, & Simon (1998) [elaborate](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/reder/publications/98_jra_lmr_has.pdf) further:

*“...\[U\]nderstanding of a domain does not come in one fell swoop of insight but is built up bit by bit over time.*

*For example, to say that a student has understood a concept such as fractions means that the student can use that knowledge flexibly in many situations. Thus, the student can figure out how much pizza each of three children will get if they have to share half a pizza; the student will recognize that, when thirty-five people must be transported by busses that each hold twenty people, two buses are required, not one-and-three-quarters; the student can explain why one inverts a fraction to divide by it; and so on. A child does not suddenly acquire the ability to do all of this.*

*The belief in moments of transformation in education is undoubtedly linked to the old belief in developmental psychology that children transit abruptly between stages. … Instead, as R. S. Siegler documents with great care, development is always gradual and continuous. The same is true of education.”*

Consequently, as Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer (1993) [emphasize](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice\(PsychologicalReview\).pdf), long-term motivation and commitment are essential:

*“...\[D\]eliberate practice requires effort and is not inherently enjoyable. Individuals are motivated to practice because practice improves performance. … Thus, an understanding of the long-term consequences of deliberate practice is important.”*

#### | Motivational Supplements are Not Substitutes for Deliberate Practice {#|-motivational-supplements-are-not-substitutes-for-deliberate-practice}

To this end, classroom activities that are enjoyable, collaborative, and non-repetitive (such as group discussions and freeform/unstructured [project-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning) or [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_learning) learning) can sometimes be useful for increasing student motivation and softening the discomfort associated with deliberate practice.

However, it’s important to realize that these activities are only *supplements*, not *substitutes*, for deliberate practice. Unlike deliberate practice, they do not directly move the needle on student performance – rather, they “grease the wheels” and reduce psychological friction during the process of deliberate practice. Performance improvements come directly from deliberate practice, but occasional motivational activities can inspire students to continue engaging in deliberate practice over the long term even when it feels difficult and uncomfortable.

Again, this is perhaps most obvious in the contexts of music and athletics:

* Musicians often enjoy fiddling around on their instruments and jamming with friends in a freestyle, creative way. These are fun activities that can enhance motivation and sometimes produce creative ideas that can be integrated into their defining style as artists. But elite musicians know that an even more central component of their practice routine is consistently pushing themselves beyond their repertoire, using intensely focused effort to gain new skills and improve specific areas of weakness through repetition and successive refinement.  
    
* Athletes often enjoy the camaraderie of team bonding activities, which might include “trick shot” competitions, group discussions about team goals and individual expectations, and exchanging stories and perspectives over team dinners. Again, these are fun activities that can help teammates fuel their passion for the game and feel connected to one another. However, elite athletes know that at the end of the day, their performance on the field comes from routinely pushing their physiological and mental limits every day during practice, where they focus intensely on gaining new skills and improving specific areas of weakness through repetition and successive refinement.

As is [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-olympic-dream-team.html) about famous basketball player Kobe Bryant (Cacciola, 2020):

*“At the team’s pre-Olympic training camp the following summer, Bryant was the first player to arrive. In fact, he beat most members of the coaching staff – and was getting in workouts at 5:30 a.m. … The foundation for all of Bryant’s feats – the 81-point game, the scoring titles, the series-clinching jump shots, the three championships he had already won with the Lakers – was his work ethic and desire. The spectacular was rooted in the mundane, in the monotony of hard labor.”*

The overall takeaway from this chapter is that by engaging in deliberate practice on Math Academy, you will gain the ability to reason coherently and solve problems in levels of math that you were previously unable to comprehend. But as any personal trainer will tell you: if you want to achieve your goals, you have to put in the work. Excellence is the product of effective training over a long period of time, and effective training requires intense effort focused in areas beyond your repertoire.

### Misinterpretations of Deliberate Practice {#misinterpretations-of-deliberate-practice}

Because “deliberate practice” has effectively become synonymous with “maximally effective practice,” people will sometimes refer to a form of practice as “deliberate practice” simply because they personally believe it to be maximally effective. Consequently, whenever a form of practice is claimed to be “deliberate practice,” the claim should not be taken at face value. After thorough investigation, it is not uncommon to find that someone is cutting corners on one of the two requirements of deliberate practice – “mindful” and “repetition” – and then resisting objective, quantifiable measurement of their performance that would expose the ineffectiveness of their practice. This is not always intentional – it may be an honest mistake – but regardless, it is something to watch out for.

To emphasize:

* Deliberate practice is not mindless repetition. If you’re doing the same thing over and over again, then you’re doing deliberate practice wrong. Deliberate practice is about making performance-improving adjustments on every single repetition. Any individual adjustment is small and yields a small improvement in performance, but when you compound these small changes over a massive number of cycles, you end up with massive changes and massive gains in performance. None of this happens if you’re mindlessly doing the same thing over and over again without making adjustments.

* Likewise, even if you’re mindful during practice, you can’t skimp on repetition and still call it “deliberate practice.” Deliberate practice necessitates a high volume of action-feedback-adjustment cycles in every single training session. Otherwise, the compounding doesn’t happen. Any activity that throttles the number of these cycles cannot be described as deliberate practice.

Many heated debates in math education stem from these misinterpretations of deliberate practice.

* Mindless repetition, doing the same thing over and over again without making performance-improving adjustments, is not deliberate practice.

* Likewise, any activity that throttles the volume of action-feedback-adjustment cycles is not deliberate practice (e.g., excessively challenging problems or think-pair-share).

  ***Importance:** Deliberate practice consists of individualized training activities specially chosen to improve specific aspects of a student’s performance through repetition and successive refinement.

  ***Importance:** The effectiveness of deliberate practice, and the ineffectiveness of non-deliberate practice, is so strong that metrics of professional experience that combine the two (such as “years of experience”) have been found to only weakly predict actual performance – whereas, on its own, the amount of purely deliberate practice is a much stronger predictor.*

  ***Importance:** It is “deliberate” practice that matters, not just any practice. Deliberate practice requires highly concentrated activities which might be, to some degree, aversive in nature.

  *For instance, in geometry learning, Pachman, Sweller, and Kalyuga (2013) found that more knowledgeable students even tended to choose achievable rather than difficult problems if they had the opportunity to choose. Training with these geometrical tasks resulted in minimal performance improvements. Only when a deliberate practice model was applied and these more knowledgeable students were presented with designer-selected difficult problems to solve did their skills improve.*

  *Likewise, Plant, Ericsson, Hill, and Asberg (2005) found that improvement in performance in higher education did not significantly correlate with the amount of time spent studying. It did, however, relate to concentrated learning aimed at specific performance goals.*

  *The formation of expert-like practice activities is not a single event, but a long process in itself. The acquisition of high level competence in complex domains such as mathematics is a laborious process that needs deliberate practice during a number of years.*

## Chapter 13\. Mastery Learning {#chapter-13.-mastery-learning}

***Summary:** By organizing its curriculum into a knowledge graph that keeps track of prerequisite relationships between topics, Math Academy is able to implement mastery learning, a strategy in which students demonstrate proficiency on prerequisites before advancing. While even loose approximations of mastery learning have been shown to produce massive gains in student learning, mastery learning faces limited adoption due to clashing with traditional teaching methods and placing increased demands on educators. Math Academy implements true mastery learning at a fully granular level, which requires fully individualized instruction and is only attainable through one-on-one tutoring.*

### Mastery Learning is Underused {#mastery-learning-is-underused}

One of our main paradigms is [**mastery learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning), also [proposed](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED053419.pdf) by Bloom (1968), in which students must demonstrate proficiency on prerequisite topics before moving on to more advanced topics. True mastery learning at a fully granular level requires fully individualized instruction, which is only attainable through one-on-one tutoring.

There are methods by which a single teacher can loosely approximate mastery learning, such as [Bloom’s Learning For Mastery (LFM) strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning#LFM_strategy) and [Keller’s Personalized System of Instruction (PSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keller_Plan). As Kulik, Kulik, & Bangert-Drowns (1990) [summarize](https://www.uky.edu/~gmswan3/575/kulik_kulik_Bangert-Drowns_1990.pdf):

*“In both LFM and PSI courses, material to be learned is divided into short units, and students take formative tests on each unit of material (Bloom, 1968; Keller, 1968). … Lessons in LFM courses are teacher presented, and students move through these courses at a uniform, teacher-controlled pace. Lessons in PSI courses are presented largely through written materials, and students move through these lessons at their own rates.”*

However, as Bloom (1984) [discovered](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) when characterizing the two-sigma problem, a single teacher practicing mastery learning with 30 students could only produce a one-sigma effect size as compared to the two-sigma effect size of individual tutoring. And while [numerous studies](https://www.uky.edu/~gmswan3/575/kulik_kulik_Bangert-Drowns_1990.pdf) reproduced the finding that even loose approximations of mastery learning (managed manually by a single teacher) produce substantial learning gains, most studies were unable to reproduce gains as strong as one sigma (the average effect size was about 0.5 standard deviations) (Kulik, Kulik, & Bangert-Drowns, 1990):

*“The data show that mastery learning programs have positive effects on student achievement. On the average, such programs raise final examination scores by about 0.5 standard deviations, or from the 50th to the 70th percentile, in colleges, high schools, and the upper grades of elementary schools. Although PSI and LFM strategies differ on several points and the two teaching methods have been studied in distinct ways, studies of PSI and LFM report similar results. PSI raised examination scores by an average of 0.48 standard deviations; LFM raised examination scores by an average of 0.59 standard deviations.”*

Unfortunately, despite producing well-documented learning gains in classrooms, even loose approximations of mastery learning [were not widely adopted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279650/pdf/jaba00015-0061.pdf) as they faced opposition for deviating from traditional convention and requiring more effort from teachers and administrators (Sherman, 1992). (It's true that a minority of teachers now attempt some degree of [differentiated instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction), but this is not the same as true mastery learning, which holds all students to the same standard and is completely individualized.)

As [lamented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279650/pdf/jaba00015-0061.pdf) by John Gilmour Sherman (1992), who was a co-creator, researcher, and practitioner of Keller’s Personalized System of Instruction (PSI):

*“Some PSI courses have been prohibited in spite of their success. I know of several colleagues who were given ‘cease and desist’ orders. Some are names prominent in the literature, their courses effective, according to objective data.*

*I experienced this also. Avoiding a frontal attack, the chairman of the Psychology Department at Georgetown declared by fiat that something on the order of 50% of class time must be devoted to lecturing. By reducing the possibility of self-pacing to zero, this effectively eliminated PSI courses.*

*He issued this order on the grounds that in the context of lecturing ‘it is the dash of intellects in the classroom that informs the student.’ No data were presented on this point\! The spectacle of purporting to defend scholarship while deciding the merits of instructional methods by assertion is silly.*

*The troubling aspect of all these cases was that data played no part in the decisions. It is disturbing when one has to wonder whether research on the education process makes any difference.”*

As Buskist, Cush, & DeGrandpre (1991) [elaborate](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00957005), mastery learning methods like PSI were shot down because they threatened the traditional educational establishment:

*“The first and most important task of any institution is self-preservation. Once in place, its primary goal must be to hold its ground or, if possible, advance. If this goal is not met, then its demise is eminent. PSI poses certain implications that threaten the preservation of the educational establishment and its guardians (department heads, deans, and academic vice-presidents). According to Keller,*

*‘Suppose that a system such as PSI were to be given official approval for adoption throughout the educational scale from top to bottom... With every student given individual treatment, when would formal education start?... What would happen to the classroom hour, the college quarter, the semester, or the academic year?... Who would win the scholarships and prizes? Who would make Phi Beta Kappa? Who would be the class valedictorian?... What changes would be made in the payment of tuition when the period of course attendance varied? How would a course of study be defined?’*

*In other words, the major impediment to educational reform is the educational system itself. That is perhaps why all major efforts at educational reform in this century have been directed at renovating curricula and not at changing how teachers teach (see, e.g., Skinner, 1984; McGovern, 1990).*

*Revamping curricula requires no revamping of the educational establishment. The curriculum changes, but that is all. Courses are still taught by lecture within a term's time. Grade distributions still approximate the normal curve and students enroll in upper division courses without first mastering more fundamental material. Students still take about four years, give or take a term, to finish what higher education demands of them.*

*The Keller Plan runs contrary to this strategy. It is a bold attempt to change how we teach, despite what we teach. In an entirely PSI-based college, students might finish in two years, maybe sooner, and learn a good deal more. Imagine what would happen if the entire educational system were PSI-based: huge numbers of people, most still in the throes of puberty, might be graduating from college-an unsettling thought for many educators. Indeed, PSI represents a threat to the educational system and its guardians.*

*PSI simply does not fit well into our modern educational system. The longstanding tradition of teaching by lecture has accumulated inertia that has proven difficult to dislodge. In the interests of self-preservation, the educational establishment has backed reforms favoring what teachers teach instead of how teachers teach.”*

### Implementing Mastery Learning {#implementing-mastery-learning}

The traditional convention is to march students through a linear sequence of topics according to a predetermined schedule (like that shown below). Any students who get lost are continually asked to learn new topics despite not having mastered the prerequisites. As a result, those students spend class time learning little to nothing and developing a general distaste for math.

![][image27]

Math Academy, however, implements true mastery learning at a fully granular level. We accomplish this by organizing topics into a **knowledge graph** that shows all the topics and **prerequisite relationships** between them. In the knowledge graph below, arrows point from simpler prerequisite topics to more advanced “post”-requisite topics.

![][image28]

By overlaying a student’s progress on the knowledge graph, we can identify the topics that they are ready to learn – that is, the topics for which they have demonstrated a sufficient level of proficiency on the prerequisites. We only serve students lessons on these topics. If a student gets stuck on a topic, they can try again another day, but in the meantime, they are allowed to learn other topics that don’t depend on the problematic one.

![][image29]

It is infeasible for a single teacher, who can only teach one topic at a time, to manually support true mastery learning across a class full of students who all have different learning profiles. As researchers have [discovered](https://osf.io/3r6a5/download), knowledge profiles vary immensely even across students in the same grade (Pedersen, et al., 2023):

*“our results suggest that nearly 38% and 49% of students in grade four and eight classrooms may either struggle to understand ‘grade-level’ content or have already mastered the content, respectively.”*

However, Math Academy’s fully-automated interactive lessons support de-synchronized learning where different students are simultaneously taught different topics. With a software system that emulates the decisions of an expert tutor, we are able to provide fully individualized instruction at scale and achieve true mastery learning at a fully granular level.

### Knowledge Frontier as Zone of Proximal Development {#knowledge-frontier-as-zone-of-proximal-development}

Mastery learning is closely related to Vygotsky’s [**Zone of Proximal Development**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development), which refers to the range of tasks that a student is able to perform while supported, but cannot do on their own. Students maximize their learning when they are completing tasks within this range.

In the context of an adaptive learning system, a student’s zone of proximal development coincides with their **knowledge frontier** or **edge of mastery**, the set of new topics for which they have mastered the prerequisites. Selecting new learning tasks from a student’s knowledge frontier can lead to drastic improvements in learning.

For instance, another learning platform has [reported](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/AIED2019_paper_133.pdf) (Zou et al., 2019\) that even when a teacher has access to student performance data chooses a new topic that they believe is appropriate for the class, a student is about 3-4x as likely to be successful in mastering that topic if it lies along their knowledge frontier (as opposed to residing beyond their frontier). This led the authors to conclude that

*“...\[S\]imply providing teachers with data is not always sufficient for good instructional decision making. … Optimizing learning outcomes requires correct teaching decisions that lead students on the right path, based on the student’s ZPD \[Zone of Proximal Development\].”*

A student’s knowledge frontier can be visualized as the edge of their **knowledge profile**, which, loosely speaking, represents how “developed” their mathematical brain is. Every time they learn a new math topic, it’s as if they grow a new brain cell and connect it to existing brain cells. Initially, this new brain cell is weak and requires frequent nurturing, but over time it becomes strong and requires less frequent care.

For instance, a knowledge profile for a second-semester calculus student is visualized below. Learned topics are shaded (with darker shading indicating that more successful practice has been completed), and arrows between topics represent prerequisite relationships.

![][image30]

(Note that this visualization only shows a “subsystem” within the student’s full mathematical brain – there are several hundred topics in the calculus course, but there are thousands of topics in Math Academy’s entire mathematical curriculum, which spans elementary school through university-level math.)

The **knowledge frontier** is the edge of the knowledge profile. It separates what the student knows from what they don’t know.

* The student knows all the simpler topics below their knowledge frontier. That is, they know all the prerequisites, the prerequisites of the prerequisites, and so on.

* However, they do not know any of the advanced topics at or above their knowledge frontier.

![][image31]

When a student first starts on the Math Academy system, we begin with a **placement diagnostic**, a [**dynamic assessment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_assessment) that quickly estimates their knowledge frontier. Following the diagnostic, whenever a student is served new lessons, those lessons always cover topics that are on the student’s estimated knowledge frontier, and the estimated knowledge frontier quickly becomes more accurate as the student completes those lessons.

## Chapter 14\. Minimizing Cognitive Load {#chapter-14.-minimizing-cognitive-load}

***Summary:** When the cognitive load of a learning task exceeds a student’s working memory capacity, the student experiences cognitive overload and is not able to complete the task. Math Academy avoids cognitive overload by finely scaffolding content with numerous small steps: each lesson is broken up into several “knowledge points” of increasing difficulty, each containing a worked example and requiring the student to demonstrate mastery on practice problems before proceeding to the next knowledge point. Our content is about 10x more finely scaffolded than what you’d find elsewhere. This makes learning accessible to all students regardless of their working memory capacity. Scaffolding is gradually removed as students progress, ensuring sustained learning without dependence on supports.*

### The Learning Staircase {#the-learning-staircase}

Learning is like climbing a staircase. Each step is a learning task – the higher the step, the more advanced the topic is. At the top of the staircase is [**higher-order thinking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_thinking) such as critical thinking and problem solving. However, different students have different stair-climbing abilities, and many students never make it to the top because they get stuck at individual stairs that are too tall for them to climb.

Math Academy’s solution is to split individual stairs into even smaller stairs so that all students can climb them. The smaller we make the individual stairs, the more students can climb all the way to the top.

For instance, a typical calculus textbook might consist of 100 steps (10 chapters × 10 sections in each chapter). But in our calculus course, we have about 1000 steps (\~300 topics × 3-4 **knowledge points** or stages of increasing difficulty per topic). In other words, our content is about 10x more finely [scaffolded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_scaffolding) than what you’d find elsewhere.

In technical terms, we are [**minimizing cognitive load**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load). Cognitive load refers to the amount of [**working memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory) that is required to complete a task. Working memory consists of limited-capacity, limited-duration [short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory) storage along with capabilities for organizing, manipulating, and generally “working” with the information stored in short-term memory.

In the staircase analogy, the height of each step represents cognitive load. Different students have different working memory capacities, and if the cognitive load of a learning task exceeds a student’s working memory capacity, then the student will not be able to complete the task due to **cognitive overload**. 

Cognitive overload has massive negative ramifications for students: not only has working memory capacity been [shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232435921_The_Relationship_Between_Working_Memory_and_Mathematical_Problem_Solving_in_Children_at_Risk_and_Not_at_Risk_for_Serious_Math_Difficulties) to predict performance in mathematical problem solving (Swanson & Beebe-Frankenberger, 2004), but perhaps shockingly, it has also been [shown](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tracy-Alloway/publication/223032127_Investigating_the_predictive_roles_of_working_memory_and_IQ_in_academic_attainment/links/59e0eb300f7e9b97fbdf4e08/Investigating-the-predictive-roles-of-working-memory-and-IQ-in-academic-attainment.pdf) to be a better predictor than IQ when predicting a young student’s future academic success (Alloway & Alloway, 2010). By minimizing the cognitive load and avoiding cognitive overload, we make learning accessible to many students for whom it would otherwise be insurmountable.

![][image32]

Math Academy maintains this high level of scaffolding even when teaching higher-order thinking. In our multi-part problems, students explore challenging, complex problem contexts one part at a time, and each part leverages an individual skill that they have previously learned in an earlier topic. This way, we fully “split up the staircase” as students climb from practicing individual skills in isolation to combining skills in novel higher-order problem contexts.

### Micro-Scaffolding {#micro-scaffolding}

Even within individual knowledge points, we take additional measures to minimize cognitive load. Each knowledge point starts with a demonstration or [**worked example**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worked-example_effect), which has been shown by [numerous studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248498261_The_worked_example_effect_and_human_cognition) (see Sweller, 2006 for a review) to reduce cognitive load and help students develop a baseline mental framework or [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_\(psychology\)) when their level of understanding is initially low.

After the worked example, students solve problems that are similar to the worked example, only progressing onto the next knowledge point once they have demonstrated mastery of the previous one. This way, we avoid asking students to solve problems that overload their working memory capacity.

![][image10]

In the explanations of worked examples and practice questions, we leverage [**subgoal labeling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgoal_labeling) by grouping steps into meaningful units. This minimizes the number of chunks of information that students need to store in their working memory, thereby reducing cognitive load. Additionally, subgoal labeling has been [shown](https://sites.gatech.edu/richardcatrambone/files/2020/09/Catrambone1995.pdf) to help students grasp the structure of the problem, thereby enabling the learning to transfer to novel problems in the same category (Catrambone, 1995).

We also leverage [**dual-coding theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory) by including [visualizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_visualization) and [diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_diagram) when possible to help students develop [**mental images**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image). In addition to helping students make connections that they can use to recall information and consolidate information into [chunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_\(psychology\)), this also helps students avoid cognitive overload by distributing cognitive load more evenly between two [subsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory) within the working memory [system](https://tecfaetu.unige.ch/perso/maltt/carlei0/Fichiers/Baddeley1983.pdf): the **phonological loop**, which stores verbal information, and the **visuo-spatial sketchpad**, which stores visual imagery (Baddeley, 1983).

It’s worth noting that unlike most other educational programs, Math Academy makes heavy use of visualizations and diagrams throughout the entire math curriculum – not just in elementary mathematics, but all the way through university-level subjects.

For instance, just as we use flowcharts to help students classify shapes in elementary mathematics, we also use flowcharts to help students classify series in Calculus:

![][image33]

The visualization doesn’t stop at Calculus. It continues all the way through more advanced university-level courses like Multivariable Calculus – even Abstract Algebra, an upper-level math-major course about the “structure” of abstract mathematical objects, whose textbooks and lectures are usually associated with dense, dry, image-less strings of symbols.

![][image35]

### The Expertise Reversal Effect {#the-expertise-reversal-effect}

While it’s important to use scaffolding to minimize cognitive load when students are learning new material, it’s also important to gradually strip away the scaffolding as they become comfortable with that material so that the scaffolding does not become a crutch. This phenomenon is known as the [**expertise reversal effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expertise_reversal_effect): the instructional techniques that promote the most learning in beginners, promote the least learning in experts, and vice versa.

On Math Academy, after a student completes an initial lesson on a topic, we gradually strip away scaffolding during later reviews. While we scaffold lessons by having students solve questions that are similar to worked examples (one worked example at a time), we mix up review problems so that it is not obvious which worked example is the best reference. This encourages students to solve review problems without referring to the worked examples – and while they can go back to the lesson and dig up a similar example for reference if they get really stuck on a review problem, even students who do this must reason about the structure of their problem to match it to helpful reference material.

We also continually quiz our students on the material that they have learned – and during quizzes, no scaffolding is provided. Quizzes are quick and frequent, but each quiz covers a wide variety of previously learned material. Additionally, quizzes are timed, and students are unable to refer back to lessons for reference.

## Chapter 15\. Developing Automaticity {#chapter-15.-developing-automaticity}

***Summary:** Automaticity is the ability to perform low-level skills without conscious effort. Analogous to a basketball player effortlessly dribbling while strategizing, automaticity allows individuals to avoid spending limited cognitive resources on low-level tasks and instead devote those cognitive resources to higher-order reasoning. In this way, automaticity is the gateway to expertise, creativity, and general academic success. However, insufficient automaticity, particularly in basic skills, inflates the cognitive load of tasks, making it exceedingly difficult for students to learn and perform.*

### Importance of Automaticity {#importance-of-automaticity}

#### | Automaticity Frees Up Working Memory {#|-automaticity-frees-up-working-memory}

An essential yet often-overlooked part of minimizing cognitive load is developing [**automaticity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity) on basic skills – that is, the ability to execute low-level skills without having to devote conscious effort towards them. Automaticity is necessary because it frees up limited working memory to execute multiple lower-level skills in parallel and perform higher-level reasoning about the lower-level skills.

As a familiar example, think about all the skills that a basketball player has to execute in parallel: they have to run around, dribble the basketball, and think about strategic plays, all at the same time. If they had to consciously think about the mechanics of running and dribbling, they would not be able to do both at the same time, and they would not have enough brainspace to think about strategy.

This extends to academics as well. As [described](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315885025/visible-learning-science-learn-john-hattie-gregory-yates) by Hattie & Yates (2013, pp.53-58):

*“You cannot comprehend a ‘big picture’ if your mind’s energies are hijacked by low-level processing. Continuity is broken. The goal shifts from understanding the total context to understanding the immediate word before you. … If you read connected text (such as sentences) at any pace under 60 wpm, then understanding what you read becomes almost impossible.*  
*…*  
*Many \[students\] arrive at school with a lack of automaticity within their basic sound-symbol functioning. With a minimal level of phonics training, they may be able to fully identify letters, verbalise sound symbol relationships, and read isolated words through sheer effort. But, if the pace of processing is not brought up to speed, through intensive self-directed practice, reading for understanding will remain beyond grasp.*  
*…*  
*A well-replicated finding is that students who present with difficulties in mathematics by the end of the junior primary years show deficits in their ability to access number facts with automaticity. Such deficits stymie further development in this area, often with additional adverse consequences such as students experiencing lack of confidence, lack of enjoyment, and feelings of helplessness.”*

#### | Working Memory is Limited, but Long-Term Memory is Not {#|-working-memory-is-limited,-but-long-term-memory-is-not}

Unfortunately, working memory has such [limited capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two) that most people can only hold a handful of pieces of new information simultaneously in their heads ([spanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_span) about [7 digits](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2364276_4/component/file_2364275/content), or more generally [4 chunks](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/magical-number-4-in-shortterm-memory-a-reconsideration-of-mental-storage-capacity/44023F1147D4A1D44BDC0AD226838496) of [coherently grouped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_\(psychology\)) items), and only for about [20 seconds](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470215808416249?journalCode=qjpa) as the memory [degrades](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241183/) from decay or interference (Miller, 1956; Cowan, 2001; Brown, 1958; Ricker, Vergauwe, & Cowan, 2016). And that assumes they aren’t needing to perform any mental manipulation of those items – if they do, then [fewer items](https://academic.oup.com/geronj/article-abstract/36/5/605/550194) can be held due to competition for limited processing resources (Wright, 1981). This severe limitation of the working memory when processing novel information is [known](http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/31186/1/125.John%20Sweller.pdf) as the **narrow limits of change principle** (Sweller, Ayres, & Kalyuga, 2011).

An intuitive analogy by which to understand the limits of working memory is to think about how your hands place a constraint on your ability to hold and manipulate physical objects. You can probably hold your phone, wallet, keys, pencil, notebook, and water bottle all at the same time – but you can’t hold much more than that, and if you want to perform any activities like sending a text, writing in your notebook, or uncapping your water bottle, you probably need to put down several items.

In the same way, your working memory only has about 7 slots for new information, and once those slots are filled, if you want to hold more information or manipulate the information that you are already holding, you have to clear out some slots to make room.

(Note that while this “slots” analogy describes the *function* of working memory capacity, the underlying *mechanism* is more nuanced: the actual limitation is not a fixed number of neural storage units, but rather the ability to sustain relevant neural activity while suppressing interference from irrelevant neural activity. At a biological level, hitting a working memory capacity limit does not entail exhausting one’s ability to maintain *more* neural activity in the energy sense, but rather exhausting one’s ability to maintain focus and attention, that is, appropriate *concentration* or *allocation* of one’s neural activity.)

![][image36]

In particular, you can’t solve a problem if you can’t fit all its pieces in your working memory. This means that if a student doesn’t achieve automaticity on lower-level skills, it doesn’t even matter how well the teacher scaffolds a new skill – they won’t be able to do it. And even for tasks within a student’s cognitive capacity, it has been [shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12058826_Systematic_Mathematical_Errors_and_Cognitive_Load) that a heavy cognitive load drastically increases the likelihood of errors (Ayres, 2001).

When you develop automaticity on a skill or piece of information, however, you can use it without it occupying a slot in your working memory. Instead, the skill is stored in your [**long-term memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory), where indefinitely many things can be held for indefinitely long without requiring cognitive effort.

As Anderson (1987) [summarizes](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED264257.pdf), automaticity can effectively turn long-term memory into an extension of short-term memory:

*“[Chase and Ericsson (1982)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA114634.pdf) showed that experience in a domain can increase capacity for that domain. Their analysis implied that what was happening is that storage of new information in long-term memory, became so reliable that long-term became an effective extension of short-term memory.”*

For emphasis, we quote Chase and Ericsson (1982) [directly](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA114634.pdf):

*“The major theoretical point we wanted to make here is that one important component of skilled performance is the rapid access to a sizable set of knowledge structures that have been stored in directly retrievable locations in long-term memory. We have argued that these ingredients produce an effective increase in the working memory capacity for that knowledge base.”*

#### | Expertise Requires Automaticity {#|-expertise-requires-automaticity}

Automaticity is the mental capacity that differentiates experts from beginners, a phenomenon that has been thoroughly [studied](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~otoole/CGS2301_S09/15_expert.pdf) in various contexts including the game of chess. As summarized by Ross (2006):

*“...\[A\] typical grandmaster has access to [roughly 50,000](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/1343/1/Copy-Task-NEW-BJP.pdf) to 100,000 chunks of chess information \[Gobet & Simon, 1998\]. A grandmaster can retrieve any of these chunks from memory simply by looking at a chess position, in the same way that most native English speakers can recite the poem ‘Mary had a little lamb’ after hearing just the first few words.”*

As [elaborated](https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/1343/1/Copy-Task-NEW-BJP.pdf) by Gobet & Simon (1998):

*“...\[S\]kill in playing chess depends both on (a) recognizing familiar chunks in chess positions while playing games, and (b) exploring possible moves and evaluating their consequences. … Expert memory, in turn includes slowly acquired structures in long-term memory (retrieval structures, templates) that augment short-term memory with slots (variable places) that can be filled rapidly with information about the current position.”*

Indeed, as Benjamin Bloom [noted](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198602_bloom.pdf) (1986) while identifying automaticity as a key theme in his own research on talent development, automaticity was described as the “hands and feet of genius” as early as the 19th century:

*“Our talent development studies support the 1899 research of Bryan and Harter who were concerned with the development of automaticity in expert Morse Code telegraphers. They most eloquently described the benefits of automaticity as an outcome of the learning process.*

*‘The learner must come to do with one stroke of attention what now requires half a dozen, and presently in one still more inclusive stroke, what now requires thirty-six. He must systematize the work to be done and must acquire a system of automatic habits corresponding to the system of tasks. When he has done this he is master of the situation in his \[occupational or professional\] field. … Finally, his whole array of habits is swiftly obedient to serve in the solution of new problems. Automatism is not genius, but it is the hands and feet of genius.’”*

It’s important to realize that automaticity goes beyond simple familiarity. If you truly “know” something, then you should be able to access and leverage that information both quickly and accurately. If you can't, then you're just "familiar" with it. And when learning hierarchical bodies of knowledge – whether it be math, chess, a sport, or an instrument – it’s important to truly know things, not just be familiar with them. Why? Because you can’t build on familiarity. That’s what the term “shaky foundations” refers to. You can only build on a solid foundation of knowledge.

To help students develop automaticity (and, consequently, expertise in mathematics), Math Academy requires students to practice each skill until they have reached a sufficient level of mastery. Students start at their edge of knowledge (not their edge of “familiarity”) and are not pushed forward along learning paths until they have mastered the prerequisite skills. Additionally, to help consolidate skills into long-term memory after mastery, skills are continually reviewed into the future through a systematic method called spaced repetition (which is described later in this document).

### Case Study: Computing Exponents With vs Without Automaticity  on Multiplication and Addition Facts {#case-study:-computing-exponents-with-vs-without-automaticity-on-multiplication-and-addition-facts}

To convey the importance of automaticity, it helps to walk through a case study in which we observe a problem being solved by students who have different levels of automaticity in their underlying skills. As we will see, a student’s overall learning experience can vary drastically depending on their level of automaticity.

Suppose that we have three different students – Otto, Rica, and Finn – whose names are chosen to represent their respective levels of automaticity.

* *Otto* has developed *full automaticity* on multiplication facts and procedures.

* *Rica* doesn’t know her multiplication facts – she *recalculates* them from scratch. She is able to carry out multiplication procedures, but she isn’t fully comfortable with them and has to proceed slowly, writing every single step down.

* *Finn*, likewise, doesn’t know his multiplication facts – but he doesn’t know his addition facts either, so he uses *finger-counting* for everything. He is not at all comfortable with multiplication procedures.


These students are each given a lesson on cubes of numbers. After an explanation of what it means to cube a number, and a demonstration with a worked example, they’re each given a problem to practice on their own: compute 43. Let’s observe the thought processes (both reasoning and emotions) as each of these students solves the problem.

**Otto** is so comfortable with his multiplication and addition facts that he solves the problem in 10 seconds in his head. He feels it was easy, is excited to try another, and can’t wait for harder problems like cubing negative numbers, decimal numbers, and fractions.

* *43 \= 4 × 4 × 4\. I know 4 × 4 \= 16, easy, and then 16 × 4 \= … well that’s 10 × 4 \= 40 and 6 × 4 \= 24, together making 40 \+ 24 \= 64\. Done, easy\! What’s next?*

**Rica** solves the problem in 2 minutes, but her answer is not correct. She takes another 2 minutes to correct the mistake but gets tired and wants to take a break before moving on to the next problem. She’s not looking forward to harder problems.

* *43 \= 4 × 4 × 4\. What’s 4 × 4? I don’t know, let’s compute it.*

  * *4 × 4 is the same as 4 \+ 4 \+ 4 \+ 4, which is … well, 4 \+ 4 \= 8, plus 4 is 12, plus 4 is 16\.*

* *Where was I? Oh right, 4 × 4 \= 16 and then 16 × 4 \= … ugh, gotta go through that multiplication procedure.*

  * *Put the 16 on top, then × 4 on bottom, and now we carry out the procedure. First 4 × 6 \= 6 \+ 6 \+ 6 \+ 6, count that up to get 6 \+ 6 \= 12, plus 6 is 18, plus 6 is 22\. Write down 2, carry another 2\. Then 4 × 1 \= 4, add the carried 2, write down 6\.*

* *Done. Result is 62\. Oh wait, the teacher says that’s close but not quite right. Fine, let’s try this again.*

* (Rica repeats the entire procedure above and this time gets a result of 64.)

* *Great, teacher says that 64 is right. I know there are more problems to do but that one was kind of hard and I’m tired. Teacher, can I take a break and do the next one later?*

**Finn** takes 10 minutes to solve the problem, but his answer is not correct. He tries again for another 10 minutes but makes a different mistake. The teacher has to sit with him for another 10 minutes to carry him through the problem. By the time Finn is done with the problem, it has almost been a full class period. He is totally exhausted and overwhelmed and dreads doing the rest of the homework.

* *43 \= 4 × 4 × 4\. What’s 4 × 4? I don’t know, let’s compute it.*

  * *4 × 4 is the same as 4 \+ 4 \+ 4 \+ 4, which is … ugh, gotta count all this up. This is annoying.*

    * *Start at 4, then 4 more is 5, 6, 7, 8\.*  
    * *Start at 8, then 4 more is 9, 10, 11, 12\.*  
    * *Start at 12, then 4 more is 12, 13, 14, 15\.*

  * *Phew, that took a while, but now I have 4 \+ 4 \+ 4 \+ 4 \= 15\. Why was I doing that, again? Oh right, I was really doing 4 × 4 \= 15\.*

* *Wait, we’re not even done yet. I did 4 × 4 \= 15, but that was because I wanted to do 4 × 4 × 4\. Okay so now I need to do 15 × 4\. Ew, that’s going to be even harder. I don’t like this. But fine, let’s do it.*

  * *15 × 4 is the same as 15 \+ 15 \+ 15 \+ 15, and those are big numbers so I need to line it up on paper.*

    * *Put 15 at the top, then another 15 below, then another 15, then another 15\.*

    * *Let’s add the right column:*  
      * *Start at 5, then 5 more is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\.*  
      * *Start at 10, then 5 more is 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\.*  
      * *Start at 14, then 5 more is 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\.*

    * *Write down 9, carry the 1, then add down the left column: start at 1, then 1 more is 2, then 3, then 4, then 5\. Write down the 5, we have 59\.*

* *Answer is 59\. Glad that’s over. That took forever. Oh wait, the teacher says that’s wrong. Noooo… do I have to do this whole thing over again?\! This is way too much work.*

* (Finn repeats the entire procedure above and this time gets a result of 66, which is still incorrect. He is getting very noticeably frustrated and his teacher sits down with him to go through his work. They find and fix several errors together and arrive at the correct result of 64.)

* *I can’t do any more of this today. I’m too tired. I hate math, and my teacher gives me way too much work. And the next problem looks harder, and there are even more on the homework\! This is terrible. Class is almost over so I’m just going to zone out until the bell rings.*

This case study demonstrates that the more automaticity a student has on their lower-level skills,

* the easier they will find it to acquire new higher-level skills,

* the more quickly and independently they will be able to execute those skills,

* the better they will feel about the learning process as a whole, and

* the more excited they will be to continue learning more advanced material.

Students who develop automaticity will feel empowered, while students who do not will feel overwhelmed and defeated.

### Automaticity, Creativity, and Higher-Level Thinking {#automaticity,-creativity,-and-higher-level-thinking}

#### | Automaticity is Necessary for Creativity {#|-automaticity-is-necessary-for-creativity}

The relationship between automaticity and creativity is commonly misunderstood. Some people think that automaticity and creativity are opposite and competing forces: supposedly, because automaticity requires repeated practice, it turns students into mindless robots, whereas to leverage the power of human creativity, one needs to break free from that robotic mindset. This line of reasoning might sound alluring – and even convenient, since students often don’t enjoy the repeated practice that’s required to develop automaticity – but there’s one problem: it’s completely false.

In reality, automaticity is a necessary component of creativity. The whole purpose of automaticity is to *reduce* the amount of bandwidth that the brain must allocate to robotic tasks, thereby freeing up cognitive resources to engage in higher-level thinking.  If a student does not develop automaticity, then they will have to consciously think about every low-level action that they perform, which will exhaust their cognitive capacity and leave no room for high-level creative thinking.

As a concrete example, consider what is typically considered one of the most creative activities: writing. Effective writing requires a frictionless pipeline from ideas in one’s mind to words on paper. If a writer had to consciously think about spelling, grammar, word definitions, transitions between sentences, when to make a new paragraph, etc, they would become bogged down in low-level robotic tasks and would have no mental bandwidth to think about high-level creative details like vivid imagery, logical cohesiveness, and emotions evoked by various phrases and ideas.

Indeed, the importance of automaticity is [documented](https://hillkm.com/EDUC_715/Unit_6/kellogg_whiteford_2009.pdf) by researchers in the field of writing education (Kellogg & Whiteford, 2009):

*“Serious, effective composition is at once a severe test of memory, language, and thinking ability … it depends on the author’s ability to manage the burdensome demands made on working memory by the task of written composition.*  
*…*  
*\[T\]he necessary coordination and control cannot succeed without reducing the relative demands that planning, generation, and reviewing make on working memory. The writer cannot flexibly and adaptively coordinate planning, generating, and reviewing when the needs of any single process consume too many available resources. The writer cannot be mindful of the whole while struggling with the parts.”*

What’s more, this view is supported by an overwhelming amount of research over at least the past half-century:

*“Empirical support for the importance of working memory resources, especially executive attention, in the development of advanced writing skills is strong. First, a measurement of overall working memory capacity in college students correlates with their writing performance (Ransdell & Levy, 1996). Vanderberg and Swanson (2007) extended such findings by discovering that it is individual differences in central executive capacity that reliably accounts for variability in writing skills among 10th graders in high school. Controlled executive attention, rather than the storage of representations, is most critical in explaining individual differences in skill. Converging experimental results show that distracting executive attention with a concurrent task of remembering six digits disrupts both the quality and fluency of text composition (Ransdell, Levy, & Kellogg, 2002).*

*The advancement of writing skills from beginner to advanced levels depends on the availability of adequate working memory resources and the capacity to allocate them appropriately to planning, sentence generation, and reviewing. McCutchen (1996) reviewed a large body of evidence in support of this view. For example, children’s fluency in generating written text is limited until they master the mechanical skills of handwriting and spelling (Graham, Berninger, Abbott, & Whitaker, 1997). Learning the mechanics of writing to the point that they are automatic during primary school years is necessary to free the components of working memory for planning, generating, and reviewing. Mastery of handwriting and spelling is also a necessary condition for writers to begin to develop the control of cognition, emotion, and behavior that is needed to sustain the production of texts as adolescents (Graham & Harris, 2000).*

*Revision is constrained or even nonexistent in developing writers because of working memory limitations. Revision requires detecting a problem, diagnosing its cause, and finding an appropriate way to correct it (Flower et al., 1986). If revision fails because of working memory limitations, as opposed to knowledge of what revision entails, then providing cues to detect problems in the text should benefit revision, because writers can then devote resources solely to diagnosis and solution. Cuing in fact does improve the revision of even college students (Hacker, Plumb, Butterfield, Quathamer, & Heineken, 1994).*

*As Beal (1996) observed, very young writers have trouble even seeing the literal meaning of their texts. The beginning author focuses on his or her thoughts not on how the text itself reads. Maintaining the author’s ideas in working memory requires much, if not all, of the available storage and processing capacity of working memory in during childhood and early adolescence. This prevents the student from reading the text carefully and maintaining a clear representation of what it actually says that is independent of what the author intended to say.”*

#### | Automaticity is Necessary for Higher-Level Thinking {#|-automaticity-is-necessary-for-higher-level-thinking}

The same reasoning applies to mathematics. In order to operate at higher levels of mathematical thinking and abstract thought, it’s necessary to have developed automaticity at the lower levels. Consider the following [realization](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674729018) from a skeptic-turned-convert principal (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014, pp.44-45):

*“What about Principal Roger Chamberlain’s initial concerns about practice quizzing at Columbia Middle School – that it might be nothing more than a glorified path to rote learning? When we asked this question after the study was completed, he paused for a moment to gather his thoughts.*

*‘What I’ve really gained a comfort level with is this: for kids to be able to evaluate, synthesize, and apply a concept in different settings, they’re going to be much more efficient at getting there when they have the base of knowledge and the retention, so they’re not wasting time trying to go back and figure out what that word might mean or what that concept was about. It allows them to go to a higher level.’”*

To put it bluntly, [according](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jake-Mcmullen/publication/317035771_Cultivating_mathematical_skills_From_drill-and-practice_to_deliberate_practice/links/6192129bd7d1af224bef75bb/Cultivating-mathematical-skills-From-drill-and-practice-to-deliberate-practice.pdf) to Lehtinen et al. (2017):

*“Fluency in basic arithmetic tasks and number combination skills has proved to be crucial for later mathematical learning and weaknesses in automatization of these skills is characteristic of mathematically disabled children.”*

Allen-Lyall (2018) [elaborates](https://iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/download/325/333) further:

*“Internalized facts allow for efficient mental computations that make easier multi-step problem solving or recognizing and making connections between mathematical concepts, such as multiplication and division, ratio comparison, fraction equivalencies, or exploration of object relationships in the world of geometry (Chapin & Johnson, 2006; National Research Council, 2005).*  
*…*  
*When one internalizes multiplication facts, less brainpower is required to perform tasks that require more complex or successive arithmetic manipulations (Geary, 1999; Geary, Saults, Liu, & Hoard, 2000). Flexible thinking and conceptual leaps between mathematical concepts are possible when products are not computed using successive addition or determined by visual inspection of tables or charts (Royer, 2003). The relationship between factors and products becomes a point of departure into more challenging mathematics. Beginning every new mathematical step forward with a return to multiplication as repeated addition or reliance upon visual assistance may interrupt intuitive mathematical thinking (Goswami, 2008).*

*Fluid mental computations are thwarted by the needs of working memory necessarily allocated to ascertaining the product of two factors or, conversely, the factors of a particular product. Memorizing facts reduces cognitive load, allowing for working memory to better allocate resources when processing number relationships required by more complex mathematics (Goswami, 2008; LeFevre, DeStefano, Coleman & Shanahan, 2005).”*

#### | Automaticity is a Gatekeeper to Mathematical Literacy and Academic Success {#|-automaticity-is-a-gatekeeper-to-mathematical-literacy-and-academic-success}

In a broader scope, Allen-Lyall (2018) also explains how automaticity on math facts is a gatekeeper to mathematical literacy, which in turn impacts future academic and career prospects:

*“Extending beyond successful school mathematics performance, broader options for college study and employment opportunity become increasingly likely when one feels confident in one’s mathematical thinking and is able to demonstrate solid achievement (Atweh & Clarkson, 2001; Marsh & Hau, 2004; Valero, 2004; Williams & Williams, 2010).*

*For myriad reasons, facts acquisition becomes an educational gatekeeper to true mathematical literacy. Consequently, helping children to be successful with this seemingly small element of early mathematics learning truly matters in a world rife with challenges requiring the mathematical communication of ideas between and within fields (D’Ambrosio & D’Ambrosio, 1994; Thomas, 2001).”*

As other researchers have [discovered](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/135467999387289), the impact on academic achievement begins immediately: students who are slow on their basic math facts begin falling behind their faster peers as soon as multi-digit arithmetic (Joy Cumming & Elkins, 2010).

*“Profiles of children based on latency performance on the fact bundles were clustered. The slowest cluster reported use of counting strategies on many bundles; the fastest cluster reported use of retrieval or efficient-thinking strategies. Cluster group was the best predictor of performance on multidigit tasks. Addition fact accuracy contributed only for tasks without carrying, and grade level was not significant. Analysis by error type showed most errors on the multidigit sums were due to fact inaccuracy, not algorithmic errors. The implication is that the cognitive demands caused by inefficient solutions of basic facts made the multidigit sums inaccessible.”*

In retrospect, beliefs that paint a false dichotomy between automaticity and creativity are not only factually incorrect, but amusingly ironic. Such beliefs suggest that de-emphasizing repetition promotes creativity as a skill for life success – when in reality, it causes students to perpetually spend mental bandwidth on low-level tasks that they could have (through repetition) learned to do automatically, thereby limiting their capacity for higher-level and creative mathematical thinking, as well as their future academic and career prospects.

### Neuroscience of Automaticity {#neuroscience-of-automaticity}

At a physical level in the brain, automaticity involves developing strategic neural connections that reduce the amount of effort that the brain has to expend to activate patterns of neurons. 

Researchers have [observed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432816304570) this in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans of participants performing tasks with and without automaticity (Shamloo & Helie, 2016). When a participant is at wakeful rest, not focusing on a task that demands their attention, there is a baseline level of activity in a network of connected regions known as the [default mode network (DMN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network). The DMN represents background thinking processes, and people who have developed automaticity can perform tasks without disrupting those processes:

*“The DMN is a network of connected regions that is active when participants are not engaged in an external task and inhibited when focusing on an attentionally demanding task … at the automatic stage (unlike early stages of categorization), participants do not need to disrupt their background thinking process after stimulus presentation: Participants can continue day dreaming, and nonetheless perform the task well.”*

When an external task requires lots of focus, it inhibits the DMN: brain activity in the DMN is reduced because the brain has to redirect lots of effort towards supporting activity in task-specific regions. But when the brain develops automaticity on the task, it increases connectivity between the DMN and task-specific regions, and performing the task does not inhibit the DMN as much:

*“...\[S\]ome DMN regions are deactivated in initial training but not after automaticity has developed. There is also a significant decrease in DMN deactivation after extensive practice.*  
*…*  
*The results show increased functional connectivity with both DMN and non-DMN regions after the development of automaticity, and a decrease in functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex. Together, these results further support the hypothesis of a strategy shift in automatic categorization and bridge the cognitive and neuroscientific conceptions of automaticity in showing that the reduced need for cognitive resources in automatic processing is accompanied by a disinhibition of the DMN and stronger functional connectivity between DMN and task-related brain regions.”*

In other words, automaticity is achieved by the formation of neural connections that promote more efficient neural processing, and the end result is that those connections reduce the amount of effort that the brain has to expend to do the task, thereby freeing up the brain to simultaneously allocate more effort to background thinking processes.

  ***Importance:** In the field of writing, the importance of automaticity is supported by an overwhelming amount of research over at least the past half-century. Serious, effective composition places burdensome demands on working memory. In order to free the components of working memory for planning, generating, and reviewing, students must learn the mechanics of writing to the point that they are automatic during primary school years. The writer cannot be mindful of the whole while struggling with the parts.*

  ***Importance:** Facts acquisition is an educational gatekeeper to true mathematical literacy. Internalized facts allow for efficient mental computations that make easier multi-step problem solving or recognizing and making connections between mathematical concepts. Memorizing facts reduces cognitive load, allowing for working memory to better allocate resources when performing tasks that require more complex or successive manipulations.*

  ***Importance:** The impact of automaticity on academic achievement begins immediately: students who are slow on their basic math facts begin falling behind their faster peers as soon as multi-digit arithmetic.*

* Shamloo, F., & Helie, S. (2016). [Changes in default mode network as automaticity develops in a categorization task.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166432816304570) *Behavioural Brain Research, 313*, 324-333.

  ***Importance:** Automaticity is achieved by the formation of neural connections that promote more efficient neural processing, and the end result is that those connections reduce the amount of effort that the brain has to expend to do the task, thereby freeing up the brain to simultaneously allocate more effort to background thinking processes.*

## Chapter 16\. Layering {#chapter-16.-layering}

***Summary:** Layering is the act of continually building on top of existing knowledge – that is, continually acquiring new knowledge that exercises prerequisite or component knowledge. This causes existing knowledge to become more ingrained, organized, and deeply understood, thereby increasing the structural integrity of a student’s knowledge base and making it easier to assimilate new knowledge. To reap the benefits of layering, Math Academy moves students forward to new topics immediately after they demonstrate mastery of prerequisites, and employs a highly-connected curriculum where new topics exercise and build on earlier topics.*

### Facilitation and Structural Integrity {#facilitation-and-structural-integrity}

#### | Facilitation {#|-facilitation}

As students learn progressively more advanced material, they reinforce and deepen their foundational knowledge. In academic literature, this is known as **facilitation**: when a new task exercises knowledge learned in a prior task, learning can be facilitated in two ways:

* (*Retroactive Facilitation*) The new task can restore memory of prior knowledge to the [same extent](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-02050-001) as identical repetition of the prior task, leading to [long-lasting retention](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00028312022003369) (Ausubel, Robbins, & Blake, 1957; Arzi, Ben-Zvi, & Ganiel, 1985).

* (*Proactive Facilitation*) Knowledge acquired during the prior task can [improve](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00028312022003369) the acquisition of knowledge that is specific to the new task (Arzi, Ben-Zvi, & Ganiel, 1985).

As a concrete example, consider that multiplication is a component skill in both long division and exponentiation. When you learn long division, you also practice the more basic skill of multiplication, which not only reinforces your knowledge of multiplication (*retroactive facilitation*), but also makes it easier for you to learn how to compute exponents (*proactive facilitation*).

![][image37]

To take advantage of facilitation, it is necessary to continually **layer** on top of existing knowledge – that is, continually acquire new knowledge that exercises prerequisite or component knowledge. In general, the more connections ([neural, cognitive, social, and experiential](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED432314.pdf)) there are to a piece of knowledge, the more ingrained, organized, and deeply understood it is (Cross, 1999), and the easier it is to recall via [spreading activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreading_activation) through connections. The most efficient way to increase the number of connections to existing knowledge is to continue layering on top of it.

#### | Structural Integrity {#|-structural-integrity}

Layering produces [**structural integrity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_integrity_and_failure), a well-known engineering concept that also applies to knowledge (the underlying structure of one’s knowledge is known as their [**schema**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_\(psychology\))). When advanced features are built on top of a system, they sometimes fail in ways that reveal previously-unknown foundational weaknesses in the underlying structure. This forces engineers to fortify the underlying structure so that the system can accommodate new elements without compromising its integrity.

Fortifying the underlying structure often requires improving its organization and elegance, which, when applied to student schemas, produces deep understanding and insight. When the structural integrity of a system is increased, it also becomes easier to add more advanced features *in general*. In the same way, when the structural integrity of a student’s schema is increased, it becomes easier to assimilate new knowledge *in general*. 

### How We Layer {#how-we-layer}

To reap the benefits of layering, Math Academy employs two key features:

1. Moving students forward to new topics immediately after they demonstrate mastery of prerequisites.

2. A highly-connected curriculum where new topics exercise and build on earlier topics.

After a student completes a lesson on Math Academy, new lessons are immediately unlocked. The student will later review what they learned in the lesson that they completed, but they are not “held back” to practice already-learned topics any more than is necessary. This stands in contrast to traditional classrooms, where students are often tethered to the pace of the class and prevented from learning more advanced concepts that come later in the class schedule or in a higher grade level, even though they have already mastered the prerequisites.

Additionally, Math Academy’s curriculum is intentionally structured so that earlier topics are applied and reinforced in higher-level topics. We have

* advanced application topics that transition students from purely mathematical framings to contexts involving word problems,

* topics that explicitly teach non-obvious connections between other topics, and

* multi-part problems that pull together many earlier topics to explore a challenging, complex problem context one part at a time.

A high degree of connectivity also arises naturally from our principle that *any lesson should cover all types of problems that a student could reasonably be expected to solve if they truly know the topic.*

It’s worth noting that unlike Math Academy, many other educational resources violate this principle and consequently lose out on the benefits of layering because their advanced topics do not actually exercise and build on earlier topics. For instance, some watered-down calculus courses steer clear of any kinds of problems that involve extensive algebra, only covering the simplest cases possible. As a result, students in those courses are not only unable to solve standard problems outside the tiny sandbox of the course, but they also do not fortify their foundations, which can lead them to forget lots of lower-level math despite taking a higher-level math course.

  ***Importance:** The more connections there are to a piece of knowledge, the more ingrained, organized, and deeply understood it is, and the easier it is to recall.*

## Chapter 17\. Non-Interference {#chapter-17.-non-interference}

***Summary:** Associative interference occurs when related knowledge interferes with recall. It is more likely to occur when highly related pieces of knowledge are learned simultaneously or in close succession. However, Math Academy mitigates the effects of interference by teaching dissimilar concepts simultaneously and spacing out related pieces of knowledge over time. This reduces confusion, enhances recall, and facilitates efficient, simultaneous learning of multiple topics, promoting smooth, rapid progress in courses while maintaining varied and engaging learning experiences.*

### Associative Interference {#associative-interference}

[**Associative interference**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_interference) describes the phenomenon that conceptually related pieces of knowledge can interfere with each other’s recall. For instance, it is easy to mistake a leopard for a cheetah.

The same happens in math. [Multiple studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jamie-Campbell-12/publication/247981688_The_role_of_associative_interference_in_learning_and_retrieving_arithmetic_facts/links/56b298f908ae795dd5c7d2cc/The-role-of-associative-interference-in-learning-and-retrieving-arithmetic-facts.pdf) have shown that well over half, and potentially as high as 90%, of multiplication mistakes are caused by interference (see Campbell, 1987 for a summary). For instance, when recalling 4 × 8, related facts like **4** × 6 \= **24** and 3 × **8** \= **24** interfere with the [spreading activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreading_activation) during the recall process and increase the likelihood of the error 4 × 8 \= 24\. (This phenomenon occurs throughout math – multiplication facts are just a convenient setting for academic studies.)

![][image38]

### Non-Interference {#non-interference}

While it is not possible for a teacher to change the structure of knowledge to make different pieces of information less related, further research in [**interference theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_theory) has revealed a factor that can be controlled by a teacher to reduce the impact of interference: time spacing. In a [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/17503018_Effect_of_temporal_separation_of_two_tasks_on_proactive_inhibition) by Underwood & Ekstrand (1967):

*“2 groups learned A-B for 32 trials, learned A-C to one perfect recitation 3 days later, and recalled A-C after 24 hr. 2 other groups learned both lists in immediate succession followed by 24-hr, recall of A-C. 1 group from each schedule had 6 A-B pairs retained in A-C. The results showed that the 3-day separation of A-B and A-C markedly reduced proactive inhibition …”*

In other words, interference is more likely to occur when highly related pieces of knowledge are learned simultaneously or in close succession – but by spacing out these related pieces of knowledge over time, a teacher can mitigate the effects of interference. We call this strategy **non-interference**.

Unfortunately, traditional classrooms ignore the benefits of non-interference and instead operate in a way that *exacerbates* the problem. The typical math curriculum is divided into units of related material and taught in subsequent lessons. This promotes confusion, impedes recall, and places a severe bottleneck on how many topics can be successfully taught simultaneously, thereby creating lots of friction and massively slowing down the learning process.

Math Academy, however, practices non-interference by teaching new concepts alongside dissimilar material. Students are allowed to choose from an array of diverse, non-overlapping learning tasks. As they complete tasks, their knowledge graphs are updated and the system chooses new topics to guide them most efficiently through the course. By utilizing non-interference, Math Academy reduces confusion, improves recall, and successfully teaches many topics simultaneously, thereby enabling students to make smooth, fast progress through their courses.

What’s more, non-interference also helps keep Math Academy’s learning tasks varied and exciting for students. Learning can feel like a grind when you are made to focus on the same types of concepts and problems for a long time, just like exercising can feel like a grind if the entire workout consists of a single exercise (especially if it’s one of your least favorite exercises). So, just like a personal trainer packs a wide variety of exercises into each workout to maintain motivation, Math Academy packs a wide variety of topics into each learning session to keep things exciting.

## Chapter 18\. Spaced Repetition (Distributed Practice) {#chapter-18.-spaced-repetition-(distributed-practice)}

***Summary:** When reviews are spaced out or distributed over multiple sessions (as opposed to being crammed or massed into a single session), memory is not only restored, but also further consolidated into long-term storage, which slows its decay. This is known as the spacing effect. A profound consequence of the spacing effect is that the more reviews are completed (with appropriate spacing), the longer the memory will be retained, and the longer one can wait until the next review is needed. This observation gives rise to a systematic method for reviewing previously-learned material called spaced repetition (or distributed practice). A repetition is a successful review at the appropriate time. Spaced repetition is complicated in hierarchical bodies of knowledge, like mathematics, because repetitions on advanced topics should “trickle down” to update the repetition schedules of simpler topics that are implicitly practiced (while being discounted appropriately since these repetitions are often too early to count for full credit towards the next repetition). However, Math Academy has developed a proprietary model of Fractional Implicit Repetition (FIRe) that not only accounts for implicit “trickle-down” repetitions but also minimizes the number of reviews by choosing reviews whose implicit repetitions “knock out” other due reviews (like dominos), and calibrates the speed of the spaced repetition process to each individual student on each individual topic (student ability and topic difficulty are competing factors).*

### Retaining Knowledge Indefinitely {#retaining-knowledge-indefinitely}

#### | The Spacing Effect {#|-the-spacing-effect}

Learning new topics is only half of the puzzle. The other half is remembering what you’ve learned. In order to retain knowledge, you must periodically review it – otherwise, in the absence of review, it will decay.

A common way to visualize memory decay is through a [**forgetting curve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), first studied by psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century:

![][image39]

Ebbinghaus (1885) [discovered](https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/index.htm) that when reviews are spaced out or *distributed* over multiple sessions (as opposed to being crammed or *massed* into a single session), memory is not only restored, but also further [**consolidated**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation) into long-term storage, which slows its decay. This is now known as the [**spacing effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect). 

#### | Spaced Repetition {#|-spaced-repetition}

A profound consequence of the spacing effect is that the more reviews are completed (with appropriate spacing), the longer the memory will be retained, and the longer one can wait until the next review is needed. This observation gives rise to a systematic method for reviewing previously-learned material called [**spaced repetition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) (or [**distributed practice**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_practice)). A **repetition** is a successful review at the appropriate time.

Here is an example that illustrates the process and power of spaced repetition. Suppose you learn a new word. Initially, you might only remember that word for a day. But if you quiz yourself on its meaning tomorrow, then you might remember it until the end of the week. And if you quiz yourself again at the end of the week, then you might remember for several weeks. If you stick to this spaced repetition schedule, then you’ll eventually be able to go [many years](https://www.academia.edu/download/92264667/1993-bahrick.pdf) between repetitions (Bahrick et al., 1993).

![][image40]![][image41]![][image42]

![][image43]

The main challenge of spaced repetition is choosing the optimal amount of time between repetitions. If you wait too long, you will forget the word and move backwards in your spaced repetition schedule. But if you perform the next repetition too early, your memory won’t strengthen as much and you won’t move forward as quickly.

#### | Building Intuition About Spaced Repetition {#|-building-intuition-about-spaced-repetition}

As Qadir & Imran (2018) [describe](https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/147253/7/147253.pdf), spaced repetition can be understood intuitively by way of analogy to muscle-building:

*“...\[M\]assed learning can give temporary fluency, just like a body builder can pump muscles temporarily by cramming exercises. However, growth only occurs with a spaced exercise routine (in which exercise and rest follow each other cyclically). Similarly, long-term learning also requires spaced practice and does not result from cramming.”*

As Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel (2014, pp.9-10, 81-82, 100-101) [elaborate](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674729018):

*“It’s widely believed by teachers, trainers, and coaches that the most effective way to master a new skill is to give it dogged, single-minded focus, practicing over and over until you’ve got it down. Our faith in this runs deep, because most of us see fast gains during the learning phase of massed practice. What’s apparent from the research is that gains achieved during massed practice are transitory and melt away quickly.*  
*…*  
*Massed practice gives us the warm sensation of mastery because we’re looping information through short- term memory without having to reconstruct the learning from long-term memory. But just as with rereading as a study strategy, the fluency gained through massed practice is transitory, and our sense of mastery is illusory. It’s the effortful process of reconstructing the knowledge that triggers reconsolidation and deeper learning.*  
*…*  
*When you recall learning from short- term memory, as in rapid- fire practice, little mental effort is required, and little long-term benefit accrues. But when you recall it after some time has elapsed and your grasp of it has become a little rusty, you have to make an effort to reconstruct it. This effortful retrieval both strengthens the memory but also makes the learning pliable again, leading to its **reconsolidation**. Reconsolidation helps update your memories with new information and connect them to more recent learning.”*

The process of **reconsolidation** can be likened (pp.73-74) to the process of composing an essay through many iterations:

*“An apt analogy for how the brain consolidates new learning may be the experience of composing an essay. The first draft is rangy, imprecise. You discover what you want to say by trying to write it. After a couple of revisions you have sharpened the piece and cut away some of the extraneous points. You put it aside to let it ferment. When you pick it up again a day or two later, what you want to say has become clearer in your mind. Perhaps you now perceive that there are three main points you are making. You connect them to examples and supporting information familiar to your audience. You rearrange and draw together the elements of your argument to make it more effective and elegant.*

*Similarly, the process of learning something often starts out feeling disorganized and unwieldy; the most important aspects are not always salient. Consolidation helps organize and solidify learning, and, notably, so does retrieval after a lapse of some time, because the act of retrieving a memory from long- term storage can both strengthen the memory traces and at the same time make them modifiable again, enabling them, for example, to connect to more recent learning. This process is called reconsolidation. This is how \[spaced\] retrieval practice modifies and strengthens learning.”*

#### | Consensus Among Researchers {#|-consensus-among-researchers}

It’s worth noting that the spacing effect is still an active area of research. As Hartwig, Rohrer, & Dedrick (2022) [describe](https://psycnet.apa.org/manuscript/2022-18497-001.pdf), there may be other factors at play besides reconsolidation – but while the exact mechanism(s) underlying the spacing effect may still be debated, the result and utility of the spacing effect is fully agreed upon by researchers:

*“Researchers have proposed numerous theoretical explanations for the spacing effect (for reviews, see Benjamin & Tullis, 2010; Delaney et al., 2010; Dempster, 1989). According to various theories, the spacing effect may derive from mechanisms such as encoding variability (i.e., contextual variation provides richer encoding when two learning episodes are spaced apart), deficient processing (i.e., processing of material during a second learning episode is diminished if close in time to the first episode), consolidation (i.e., a second learning episode benefits from any memory consolidation that occurs in the interim), or study-phase retrieval (i.e., spacing promotes effortful retrieval during a second learning episode). However, no single mechanism has accounted for the entire body of spacing-related findings, and it is possible that a combination of mechanisms may best explain the effect (Delaney et al., 2010).*

*Regardless of mechanism, spacing effects are robust – occurring across various materials, procedures, and learner characteristics (Dunlosky et al., 2013). Most important for the present study, spacing effects have been demonstrated in numerous classroom-based randomized studies (e.g., Seabrook et al., 2005; Sobel et al., 2011; for a review, see Dunlosky et al., 2013). Moreover, classroom studies have found spacing effects with math learning (Barzagar Nazari & Ebersbach, 2019; Hopkins et al., 2016; Lyle et al., 2020; Schutte et al., 2015). In short, considerable data show that spaced math practice improves scores on delayed tests. … \[T\]he literature is clear that practice should be spaced across many class sessions if students are to retain the information long-term (Rawson et al., 2013; Rawson et al., 2018).”*

As Rohrer (2009) [states](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer2009JRME.pdf):

*“...\[T\]he spacing effect is arguably one of the largest and most robust findings in learning research, and it appears to have few constraints.”*

Indeed, [according to](https://www.teachinghowtolearn.veritytest.com.au/verity/uploads/2021/08/Policy-Insights-from-the-Behavioral-and-Brain-Sciences-2016-Kang-12-9.pdf) researcher Kang (2016), hundreds of studies have demonstrated that spaced repetition produces superior long-term retention. As a memorable example, he describes one of the earliest spaced repetition studies, whose findings have been backed up by 254 follow-up studies over the past century:

*“In one early study, to illustrate a specific instance, college students were asked to learn the Athenian Oath (Gordon, 1925). One group of students heard the oath read 6 times in a row; another group heard the oath 3 times on 1 day and 3 more times 3 days later.*

*On the immediate test, the group that received massed repetition recalled slightly more than the group that received spaced repetition. But on the delayed test 4 weeks later, the spaced group clearly outperformed the massed group.*

*While massed practice might appear \[slightly\] more effective than spaced practice in the short term, spaced practice produces durable long-term learning.”*

The benefits of spacing are so pronounced and conclusive that they have even attracted attention from the field of advertising, where the spacing effect has been [reproduced](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2015.1018460) in numerous studies of consumer memory of brands (Schmidt & Eisend, 2015).

### Spaced Repetition is Underused {#spaced-repetition-is-underused}

Unfortunately, as with mastery learning, spaced repetition deviates from traditional convention in education and consequently remains rarely used in classrooms. As Kang (2016) [laments](https://www.teachinghowtolearn.veritytest.com.au/verity/uploads/2021/08/Policy-Insights-from-the-Behavioral-and-Brain-Sciences-2016-Kang-12-9.pdf):

*“Despite over a century of research findings demonstrating the spacing effect, however, it does not have widespread application in the classroom. The spacing effect is ‘a case study in the failure to apply the results of psychological research’ (Dempster, 1988, p. 627).*  
*…*  
*When deciding on what instructional techniques to use (and when to use them), many teachers default to familiar methods (e.g., how they themselves were taught; Lortie, 1975\) or rely on their intuitions, both less than ideal: Our intuitions about learning can sometimes be plain wrong, and it would be a waste to overlook the growing evidence base regarding the effectiveness of various teaching or learning strategies.*   
*…*  
*The second major hurdle is conventional instructional practice, which typically favors massed practice. Teaching materials and aids (e.g., textbooks, worksheets) are usually organized in a modular way, which makes massed practice convenient. After presenting a new topic in class, teachers commonly give students practice with the topic via a homework assignment. But aside from that block of practice shortly after the introduction of a topic, no further practice usually follows, until a review session prior to a major exam.”*

Perhaps shockingly, Cepeda et al. (2009) [observed](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1n15d7xr/qt1n15d7xr.pdf) that even many instructional design and educational psychology textbooks have little to no coverage of spaced repetition as a learning strategy:

*“Failure to consider distributed practice research is evident in instructional design and educational psychology texts, many of which fail even to mention the distributed practice effect (e.g., Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000; Bruning, Schraw, Norby, & Ronning, 2004; Craig, 1996; Gardner, 1991; Morrison, Ross, & Kemp, 2001; Piskurich, Beckschi, & Hall, 2000).*

*Those texts that mention the distributed practice effect often devote a paragraph or less to the topic (e.g., Glaser, 2000; Jensen, 1998; Ormrod, 1998; Rothwell & Kazanas, 1998; Schunk, 2000; Smith & Ragan, 1999\) and offer widely divergent suggestions – many incorrect – about how long the lag between study sessions ought to be (cf. Gagné, Briggs, & Wager, 1992; Glaser, 2000; Jensen, 1998; Morrison et al., 2001; Ormrod, 2003; Rothwell & Kazanas, 1998; Schunk, 2000; Smith & Ragan, 1999).”*

Typically, students learn a topic during class, practice it on the homework, and then forget about it until it’s time to study for a test. After the test, students are rarely required to practice the topic again, unless it just happens that some new topic requires them to remember the old one. The end result is that students end up forgetting most of what they learn – and as Rohrer (2009) [notes](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer2009JRME.pdf), the forgetting can be so severe that it can appear as though they never learned those things in the first place:

*“The effects of forgetting are often neglected by learning theorists, but acquisition has little utility unless material is retained. Indeed, although poor performance on standard achievement tests is often attributed to the absence of acquisition, forgetting may often be the culprit.* 

*For example, in the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 50% of U.S. eighth graders were unable to correctly multiply \-5 and \-7, even though the question was presented in a multiple-choice format (Reese, Miller, Mazzeo, & Dosse, 1997). If any of these erring students knew the product previously, which seems likely, their error was likely due to forgetting.”*

Often, students don’t even realize how quickly they forget in the absence of spaced review. For instance, Emeny, Hartwig, & Rohrer (2021) [found](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611846.pdf) that students who engaged in spaced practice could predict their own future test scores fairly accurately, while students who engaged in massed practice were severely overconfident in their predictions:

*“Following spaced practice, students predicted their future test scores very accurately, whereas massed practice yielded gross overconfidence. The overconfidence after massed practice might be due to the fluency or success with which students can solve a set of similar problems by merely repeating the same procedure over and over, giving the impression that students have mastered the content. In turn, overconfidence may lead students and their teachers to believe that further practice is unnecessary when, in fact, the gains will not be retained across time.*

*Though massed practice produced overconfidence, we note that predictions following massed practice were only slightly greater than predictions following spaced practice. Thus, massed practice did not elevate predictions to an unrealistically high level but instead failed to help students recognize their low level of mastery.”*

Another factor keeping spaced repetition out of STEM classrooms in particular is that, to our best knowledge, the current literature on mathematical models for determining optimal repetition spacing is limited to the setting of independent flashcard-like tasks. STEM subjects, in contrast, are highly connected bodies of knowledge. This introduces significant modeling complexities: for instance, repetitions on advanced topics should “trickle down” to update the repetition schedules of simpler topics that are implicitly practiced (while being discounted appropriately since these repetitions are often too early to count for full credit towards the next repetition).

To overcome this hurdle, Math Academy has developed a proprietary model of **Fractional Implicit Repetition (FIRe)** that not only accounts for implicit “trickle-down” repetitions but also

* minimizes the number of reviews by choosing reviews whose implicit repetitions “knock out” other due reviews (like dominos), and

* calibrates the spaced repetition process to each individual student on each individual topic (student ability and topic difficulty are competing factors – high student ability speeds up the overall student-topic learning speed, while high topic difficulty slows it down).

Our highly sophisticated spaced repetition model is the product of years of research, practice, and development since 2019, and it continues to be refined as we gain more data on student learning outcomes.

### Spaced Repetition Improves Generalization {#spaced-repetition-improves-generalization}

People usually think of spaced repetition as a process to remember isolated pieces of information. But in a highly connected body of complex skills, like math, spaced repetition can also promote generalized learning that can more easily transfer across different contexts.

To start off with some loose intuition, think about what happens when you reread a book or rewatch a movie that you haven’t seen in a while. Often, you see things that you didn’t notice before. You come in with a different mental state compared to the last time you watched, and you come out with some fresh perspectives and a more comprehensive understanding of the work.

Indeed, a [review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00962/full) by Smith & Scarf (2017) recounted multiple studies demonstrating that *“spacing not only benefits the learning and retention of specific items but improves the generalization of learning”*:

*“Hagman (1980) had participants learn and practice electrical testing on the same equipment or different equipment, with practice massed all in 1 day or spaced on 3 consecutive days. On a transfer test after a 2-week delay, spaced practice on different equipment resulted in better transfer than spaced practice on the same equipment. Spaced practice on the same equipment resulted in better performance on the transfer test than massed practice on the same or different equipment. Moreover, massed practice on the same or different equipment resulted in equivalent performance on the transfer test, indicating that spacing was necessary for training variations to promote generalization.*

*Similarly, Moulton et al. (2006) compared massed and spaced groups who practiced microsurgical skills on PVC-artery models and arteries from a turkey thigh, and tested to what extent their skills transferred to a live rat 1 month after training. Moulton et al. (2006) found that the spaced group performed significantly better on a variety of outcome measures than the massed group.*

*Studies with children have investigated the impact of spacing on generalization using a greater range of spacing intervals relative to the adult literature. For example, Vlach and Sandhofer (2012) investigated the impact of spacing on the generalization of simple and complex science concepts in 5- to 7-year-olds. The children in their study completed 4 lessons on biomes, with each lesson involving a different context (desert, grasslands, artic, ocean or swamp), and a post-test 1 week after the last lesson. The massed group completed all four lessons in 1 day, the intermediate group completed 2 lessons per day for 2 days, and the Spaced Group completed 1 lesson per day for 4 days. For simple generalization, the spaced group showed significantly greater improvement from the pre- to post-test than the massed group, and the intermediate group’s improvement was not significantly different when compared to the massed or spaced groups. In contrast, for complex generalization, the spaced group’s improvement was significantly better than both the massed and intermediate groups. In fact, the data suggest that the spaced group is the only group to show an improvement in their gain scores as the questions moved from simple to complex, though unfortunately this trend was not tested for statistical significance. Spacing therefore may provide a greater benefit for more complex generalizations.*

*Gluckman et al. (2014) replicated Vlach and Sandhofer’s (2012) findings, but in the post-test they included questions on the children’s memory for facts and concepts talked about during the lessons (e.g., what is a biome?), in addition to generalization questions. The spaced group showed significantly greater improvement than the massed group for simple and complex generalization questions and for memory questions. The reported means displayed the same pattern as above, with spacing benefiting complex generalizations more than simple generalizations.”*

In a follow-up [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3995866/), Vlach, Sandhofer, & Bjork (2014) also found that higher-fidelity spaced repetition with expanding intervals promoted even better generalization than spaced repetition with constant intervals, suggesting that optimizing the spaced repetition process can lead to significant gains in generalization:

*“...\[W\]e examined whether an expanding learning schedule would promote generalization to a greater degree than would an equally spaced learning schedule … \[A\]t the 24-hour delayed generalization test, we observed a significant difference between the two conditions: Children in the expanding learning condition significantly outperformed children in the equal spacing condition.*  
*…*  
*These findings suggest that the benefits of expanding schedules are not constrained to memory tasks, but that these learning schedules can promote multiple types of learning, such as the acquisition and generalization of information.”*

### Repetition Compression {#repetition-compression}

A common criticism of spaced repetition is that it requires an overwhelming number of reviews. While this can be true if spaced repetition is used to learn unrelated flashcards, there is something special about the subject of mathematics that allows Math Academy to avoid this issue.

Unlike independent flashcards, mathematics is a hierarchical and highly connected body of knowledge. Whenever a student solves an advanced mathematical problem, there are many simpler mathematical skills that they practice implicitly. In other words, in mathematics, advanced skills tend to **encompass** many simpler skills.

As a result, whenever a student has due reviews, Math Academy is able to **compress** them into a much smaller set of learning tasks that implicitly covers (i.e. provides repetitions on) all of the due reviews. We call this process **repetition compression**.

To illustrate, consider the following multiplication problem, in which we multiply the two-digit number 39 by the one-digit number 6:

![][image14]

In order to perform the multiplication above, we have to multiply one-digit numbers and add a one-digit number to a two-digit number:

* First, we multiply 6 × 9 \= 54\. We carry the 5 and write the 4 at the bottom.

* Then, we multiply 6 × 3 \= 18 and add 18 \+ 5 \= 23\. We write 23 at the bottom.

In other words, *Multiplying a Two-Digit Number by a One-Digit Number* **encompasses** *Multiplying One-Digit Numbers* and *Adding a One-Digit Number to a Two-Digit Number*.

We can visualize this using an **encompassing graph** as shown below. The encompassing graph is similar to a prerequisite graph, except the arrows indicate that a simpler topic is encompassed by a more advanced topic. (Encompassed topics are usually prerequisites, but prerequisites are often not fully encompassed.)

![][image15]

Now, suppose that a student is due for reviews on all three of these topics. Because of the encompassings, the only review that they will actually have to do is *Multiplying a Two-Digit Number by a One-Digit Number*. When they complete this review, it will implicitly provide repetitions on the topics that it encompasses because the student has effectively practiced those skills as well.

| ![][image16] | →  | ![][image17] |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

In general, the more encompassings there are, the fewer reviews are actually required. And mathematics has *lots* of encompassings\!

### Calibrating to Individual Students and Topics {#calibrating-to-individual-students-and-topics}

As discussed in [chapter 7](#bookmark=id.mpm149mcoeee), the **speed** at which students learn (and remember what they’ve learned) varies from student to student. It has been [shown](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA212765.pdf) that some students learn faster and remember longer, while other students learn slower and forget more quickly (e.g., [Kyllonen & Tirre, 1988](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA212765.pdf); [Zerr et al., 2018](https://jeffberg.github.io/cv/papers/Zerr_2018_PsychologicalScience.pdf); [McDermott & Zerr, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/096372141986900)). Similarly, learning speed also varies across topics: easier topics are learned faster and remembered longer, while harder topics take longer to learn and are forgotten more quickly.

So, for each student, each topic has a learning speed that depends on the student’s ability and the topic’s difficulty. Math Academy computes these **student-topic learning speeds** and uses them to adjust the speed of the spaced review process.

* For instance, if a student does a review on a topic for which their learning speed is 2x, then that review counts as being worth 2 spaced repetitions.

* Likewise, if a student does a review on a topic for which their learning speed is 0.5x, then that review counts as being worth 0.5 spaced repetitions.

![][image45]  
![][image46]  
![][image46]

Student-topic learning speeds are also considered within the fractional implicit repetition algorithm. Whenever a topic’s spaced repetition process is being slowed down (i.e. whenever the student-topic learning speed is less than 1), we also shut down all incoming implicit repetition credit and instead force **explicit reviews**. The topic does not receive any implicit repetition credit that would normally “trickle down” from more advanced topics that encompass it.

We do this because, in practice, weaker students often have trouble absorbing implicit repetitions on difficult topics – they have a harder time generalizing that “what I learned earlier is a special case (or component) of what I'm learning now.'' The decision of whether or not to force explicit reviews is based on the student-topic learning speed because when a topic’s spaced repetition process is being slowed down, it indicates that the topic is considered rather difficult relative to the student’s ability.

Lastly, it’s important to realize that while there are a number of factors that could affect a student's learning speed, such as their aptitude, forgetting rate, level of interest/motivation, or how tired or distracted they typically are while working on learning tasks – these factors are ultimately only as relevant as their effects on the student’s observed performance, which is what we use when adapting to each student’s individual learning curve.

### Spaced Repetition vs Spiraling {#spaced-repetition-vs-spiraling}

Some curricula adopt a [**spiral approach**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_approach) where material is naturally revisited and further built upon in later textbook chapters and/or grades. Spiraling is clearly an improvement over the default mode of instruction, which includes little to no systematic review – and it allows teachers to make use of the spacing effect to some extent while teaching manually at a group level without the assistance of technology. However, spiraling is still nowhere near the level of granularity, precision, and individualization that is required to capture the maximum benefit of true spaced repetition.

Note that while spiraling is sometimes conflated with discovery learning (both are widely attributed to psychologist Jerome Bruner in the 1960s), these are really two separate ideas, the latter of which we do not intend to endorse. There are plenty of spiral curricula (e.g., [*Saxon Math*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_math)) that leverage direct instruction instead of discovery learning. The discussion here shall be concerned purely with the extent to which spiraling leverages the spacing effect, not the method by which instruction is delivered.

To understand the difference between spiraling and spaced repetition, it helps to visualize the corresponding forgetting curves. We start with the default mode of instruction, in which large groups of related material are covered all at once and are not systematically revisited in the future. Under this mode of instruction, students quickly forget what they learn, and their overall retention is extremely low.

![][image47]

By periodically revisiting content, a spiral curriculum periodically restores forgotten knowledge and leverages the spacing effect to slow the decay of that knowledge. This raises students’ overall retention of what they have learned. To illustrate, a forgetting curve for a spiral curriculum with two spirals is shown below:

![][image48]

![][image49]

Spaced repetition takes this line of thought to its fullest extent by fully optimizing the review process. It precisely calibrates the spacing of reviews so as to maintain a consistently high level of retention and slow down the decay (i.e. stretch out the decay curves) as quickly as possible. Review spacing continually adapts to student performance, expanding in response to good performance and shrinking in response to poor performance. By optimizing the review process to the fullest extent, spaced repetition further raises students’ retention of what they have learned.

![][image50]

However, while spaced repetition is more optimal, it requires an inhuman amount of work from the instructor. Taken to its fullest extent, spaced repetition requires the instructor to keep track of a repetition schedule for every topic for every student and continually update that schedule based on the student’s performance – and each time a student learns (or reviews) an advanced topic, they’re implicitly reviewing many simpler topics, all of whose repetition schedules need to be adjusted as a result.

In this view, spiraling can be characterized as “the best an instructor can do” manually while teaching at a group level without the assistance of technology. Spaced repetition is the optimal solution to maximizing retention, but it is infeasible to perform spaced repetition manually, so spiraling is the next-best option that an instructor can actually perform without the assistance of technology.

## Chapter 19\. Interleaving (Mixed Practice) {#chapter-19.-interleaving-(mixed-practice)}

***Summary:** Interleaving (or mixed practice) involves spreading minimal effective doses of practice across various skills, in contrast to blocked practice, which involves extensive consecutive repetition of a single skill. Blocked practice can give a false sense of mastery and fluency because it allows students to settle into a robotic rhythm of mindlessly applying one type of solution to one type of problem. Interleaving, on the other hand, creates a “desirable difficulty” that promotes vastly superior retention and generalization, making it a more effective review strategy. But despite its proven efficacy, interleaving faces resistance in classrooms due to a preference for practice that feels easier and appears to produce immediate performance gains, even if those performance gains quickly vanish afterwards and do not carry over to test performance.*

### Interleaving vs Blocking {#interleaving-vs-blocking}

In a traditional classroom, homework assignments usually focus on a single topic. For instance, if a student learns how to subtract multi-digit whole numbers during class, then their homework might contain 15 review problems to practice that skill. This is called **blocked practice** or **blocking**, in which a single skill is practiced many times consecutively.

While some initial amount of blocking is useful when first learning a skill, blocking is very *inefficient* for building long-term memory afterwards during the review stage. Instead of putting those 10 review problems on a single review assignment, it would be more effective to spread them out over multiple review assignments that each cover a broad mix of previously-learned topics.

For instance, one of those assignments might have the following breakdown of problems:

* (3 problems) *Subtracting Multi-Digit Whole Numbers*  
* (3 problems) *Adding One-Digit Decimals*  
* (3 problems) *Converting One-Digit Decimals Into Fractions*  
* (3 problems) *Converting Improper Fractions Into Mixed Numbers*  
* (3 problems) *Solving Word Problems Using Multi-Digit Addition*

This strategy is called **interleaving** (also known as [**varied practice**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varied_practice) or **mixed practice**).

### Benefits of Interleaving {#benefits-of-interleaving}

#### | Efficiency {#|-efficiency}

One benefit of interleaving is that it provides minimum effective doses of review for a handful of different topics, whereas blocked practice only hits a single topic and wastes most of the review effort in the realm of diminishing returns. As Rohrer & Pashler (2007) [describe](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED505647.pdf) in a paper titled *Increasing Retention without Increasing Study Time*:

*“Our results suggest that a single session devoted to the study of some material should continue long enough to ensure that mastery is achieved but that immediate further study of the same material is an inefficient use of time. … The continuation of study immediately after the student has achieved error-free performance is known as overlearning. … \[W\]hile overlearning often increases performance for a short while, the benefit diminishes sharply over time.*   
*…*  
*Because overlearning requires more study time than not overlearning, the critical question is how the benefits of overlearning compare to the benefits resulting from some alternative use of the same time period. … \[D\]evoting this study time to the review of materials studied weeks, months, or even years earlier will typically pay far greater dividends than the continued study of material learned just a moment ago.*

*In essence, overlearning simply provides very little bang for the buck, as each additional unit of uninterrupted study time provides an ever smaller return on the investment of study time.”*

As quoted elsewhere:

*“...\[O\]verlearning has the deficiencies of massed practice, and when the choice presents itself, our results suggest that overlearning will typically represent an inefficient use of study time.”* – [Pashler et al. (2007)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03194050.pdf)

*“...\[A\] typical mathematics assignment consists of many problems relating to the same skill or concept, yet evidence suggests that students receive little long-term benefit from working more than several problems of the same kind in immediate succession (e.g., Lyle, Bego, Hopkins, Hieb, & Ralston, 2020).”* – [Rohrer & Hartwig (2020)](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611861.pdf)

This can be visualized on forgetting curves (shown below), and it suggests an effective method that Math Academy uses to select topics for interleaved review: simply choose those topics whose spaced repetitions are due (or are closest to being due).

| Interleaving | Blocking |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![][image51] | ![][image52] |

#### | Discrimination and Category Induction Learning {#|-discrimination-and-category-induction-learning}

Another benefit of interleaving is that, in addition to helping students practice carrying out solution techniques, it also [enhances](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED536926.pdf) other types of learning that are necessary components of true mastery (see Rohrer, 2012 for a review):

* ([*discrimination learning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_learning)) matching problems with the appropriate solution techniques – for instance, the equations x2 \+ 3x \+ 2 \= 0 and x \+ 3x \+ 2 \= 0 look similar but require wildly different solution techniques.

* ([*category induction learning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)) recognizing general features that distinguish problems requiring different solution techniques

As Taylor & Rohrer (2010) [elaborate](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Taylor%26Rohrer2010ACP.pdf):

*“When practice problems are blocked, however, students can successfully solve a set of practice problems without learning how to pair a problem with the skill. Indeed, because all of the problems relate to the topic – typically the one presented in the immediately preceding lesson – students can choose the appropriate procedure for each practice problem before they read the problem. While this reduces the difficulty of the practice problems, students are effectively relying on a crutch. Unfortunately for students, this weakness is exposed when these same kinds of problems appear on a cumulative exam, standardized test, or during a subsequent research career.*

*By contrast, interleaved practice gives students an opportunity to practice pairing each kind of problem with the appropriate procedure. Far from being limited to statistics courses, the difficulty of pairing a problem with the appropriate procedure or concept is ubiquitous in mathematics.*

*For example, the notorious difficulty of word problems is due partly to the fact that few word problems explicitly indicate which procedure or concept is appropriate. For example, the word problem, ‘If a bug crawls eastward for 8 m and then crawls northward for 15 m, how far is it from its starting point’? requires students to infer the need for the Pythagorean Theorem. However, no such inference is required if the word problem appears immediately after a block of problems that explicitly indicate the need for the Pythagorean theorem (e.g. if the legs of a right triangle have lengths 8 and 15 m, what is the length of its hypotenuse?). Thus, blocked practice can largely reduce the pedagogical value of a word problem.*

*As a final example, it should be noted that blocked practice may facilitate students’ failure to discriminate between different kinds of problems even when these kinds of problems are not superficially similar. In elementary school, for example, students are ordinarily taught to find both the greatest common factor of two integers and the least common multiple of two integers. Thus, the instructions for these two kinds of problems are easily distinguished from each other (‘Find the greatest common factor ...’ vs. ‘Find the least common multiple ...’). However, if the practice problems of each kind are blocked, students can ignore the instruction and instead focus solely on the information that varies from problem to problem (i.e. the pair of integers). Students can then solve problems by merely repeatedly performing the same procedure without giving much thought to why it is appropriate.”*

#### | Experimental Support {#|-experimental-support}

The benefits of interleaving are supported by [numerous studies](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED536926.pdf) across a wide variety of domains including math, other academic subjects, raw cognitive tasks, motor skills, and even sports practice (see Rohrer, 2012 for a review). As [summarized](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer2009JRME.pdf) elsewhere by Rohrer (2009):

*“Experiments have shown that test scores can be dramatically improved by the introduction of spaced practice or mixed practice, which are the two defining features of mixed review. Moreover, neither spacing nor mixing requires an increase in the number of practice problems, meaning that both features increase efficiency as well as effectiveness. … Its effects on mathematics learning deserve greater consideration by teachers and researchers.”*

While blocking leads to more rapid gains in performance (which makes it useful when first learning a skill), interleaving promotes vastly superior retention and generalization (which makes it a more effective review strategy). As Rohrer, Dedrick, & Stershic (2015) [clarify](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED557355.pdf) elsewhere:

*“...\[A\] small block of problems might be optimal, especially at the outset of an assignment given immediately after students are introduced to that kind of problem, perhaps because it gives students an opportunity to focus on the execution of a strategy (e.g., procedural steps and computation). Yet students who work more than a few problems of the same kind in immediate succession are likely to receive sharply diminishing returns on their additional effort (e.g., Rohrer & Taylor, 2006; Son & Sethi, 2006).”*

It’s hard to overstate how beneficial interleaving is, especially in the context of mathematics. Taylor & Rohrer (2010) [found](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Taylor%26Rohrer2010ACP.pdf) that simply interleaving practice problems, as opposed to blocking them, doubled test scores. This phenomenon was [observed](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED557355.pdf) again by Rohrer, Dedrick, & Stershic (2015) using different, older students and more advanced math problems. As [summarized](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/) by *Scientific American* (Pan, 2015):

*“The three-month study involved teaching 7th graders slope and graph problems. Weekly lessons, given by teachers, were largely unchanged from standard practice. Weekly homework worksheets, however, featured an interleaved or blocked design. When interleaved, both old and new problems of different types were mixed together. Of the nine participating classes, five used interleaving for slope problems and blocking for graph problems; the reverse occurred in the remaining four.*

*Five days after the last lesson, each class held a review session for all students. A surprise final test occurred one day or one month later. The result? When the test was one day later, scores were 25 percent better for problems trained with interleaving; at one month later, the interleaving advantage grew to 76 percent.”*

As Rohrer, Dedrick, & Stershic (2015) [elaborate](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED557355.pdf) further, students whose practice was interleaved also demonstrated vastly superior retention of the tested material through a delay period:

*“...\[A\]part from its superiority to blocked practice, interleaved practice provided near immunity against forgetting, as the 30-fold increase in test delay reduced test scores by less than a tenth (from 80% to 74%).*  
*…*  
*Another reason for the large effects of interleaving observed here and elsewhere is that interleaved mathematics practice inherently guarantees that students space their practice. That is, in addition to the juxtaposition of different kinds of problems within an assignment, problems of the same kind are spaced across assignments.”*

### Desirable Difficulty: Why Interleaving is Underused {#desirable-difficulty:-why-interleaving-is-underused}

It is natural to ask, then: why is interleaving so rarely leveraged in classrooms? The answer is all too familiar. In addition to deviating from traditional teaching convention, interleaving has been [shown](https://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kornell/Publications/Kornell.Bjork.2008a.pdf) to suffer from the same misconception that plagues active learning: interleaving produces more learning by increasing cognitive activation, but students often *mistakenly* interpret extra cognitive effort as an indication that they are not learning as well, when in fact the opposite is true (Kornell & Bjork, 2008). Consider the following [concrete example](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674729018) (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014, pp.65):

*“In interleaving, you don’t move from a complete practice set of one topic to go to another. You switch before each practice is complete. A friend of ours describes his own experience with this:*

*‘I go to a hockey class and we’re learning skating skills, puck handling, shooting, and I notice that I get frustrated because we do a little bit of skating and just when I think I’m getting it, we go to stick handling, and I go home frustrated, saying, ‘Why doesn’t this guy keep letting us do these things until we get it?’’*

*This is actually the rare coach who understands that it’s more effective to distribute practice across these different skills than polish each one in turn. The athlete gets frustrated because the learning’s not proceeding quickly, but the next week he will be better at all aspects, the skating, the stick handling, and so on, than if he’d dedicated each session to polishing one skill.”*

Blocking, on the other hand, creates a more comfortable sense of fluent learning which artificially improves practice performance by reducing cognitive activation. When practicing a single skill many times consecutively, students settle into a robotic rhythm of mindlessly applying one type of solution to one type of problem. The mindlessness is quite literal: in a study that measured “mind-wandering” during practice, people were [found](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-53532-001) to mind-wander much more while blocking than while interleaving (Metcalfe & Xu, 2016). But the artificially improved practice performance tricks students into thinking that they are learning better, even though the effect quickly vanishes afterwards and does not actually carry over to test performance.

As [summarized](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer2009JRME.pdf) by Rohrer (2009):

*“A feature that decreases practice performance while increasing test performance has been described by Bjork and his colleagues as a **desirable difficulty**, and spacing and mixing are two of the most robust ones. As these researchers have noted, students and teachers sometimes avoid desirable difficulties such as spacing and mixing because they falsely believe that features yielding inferior practice performance must also yield inferior learning.”*

In the literature, a practice condition that makes the task harder, slowing down the learning process yet improving recall and transfer, is known as a [**desirable difficulty**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirable_difficulty). As Rohrer & Hartwig (2020) [elaborate](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611861.pdf):

*“Both spacing and interleaving are instances of a phenomenon known as a desirable difficulty (Bjork, 1994\) – the focus of this forum. A desirable difficulty is a learning method that, when compared to an alternative, makes practice more difficult while nevertheless improving scores on a subsequent test (e.g., Bjork & Bjork, 2014; Bjork, 2018; Bjork & Bjork, 2019; Bjork & Kroll, 2015; Schmidt & Bjork, 1992).”*

Many types of cognitive learning strategies introduce desirable difficulties – for instance, Bjork & Bjork (2011) [list](https://burrell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EBjorkRBjork_FABBSchapter2014-2nd-ed._WithCoverPage.pdf) a few more:

*“Such desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994; 2013\) include varying the conditions of learning, rather than keeping them constant and predictable; interleaving instruction on separate topics, rather than grouping instruction by topic (called blocking); spacing, rather than massing, study sessions on a given topic; and using tests, rather than presentations, as study events.”*

However, as Rohrer & Hartwig (2020) [explain](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611861.pdf), the idea of desirable difficulties can be counterintuitive:

*“That difficulties can be desirable is not intuitive. In fact, many people mistakenly assume that the degree of fluency achieved during practice is a good marker of a strategy’s long-term efficacy (Bjork, Dunlosky, & Kornell, 2013). Indeed, many difficulties are undesirable in that they impede not only practice performance but also test scores, as might be true for students who do homework while watching television.”*

Furthermore, as Robert Bjork (1994) [explains](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/spaced-repetition/1994-bjork.pdf), the typical teacher is incentivized to maximize the immediate performance and/or happiness of their students, which biases them against introducing desirable difficulties:

*“Recent surveys of the relevant research literatures (see, e.g., Christina & Bjork, 1991; Farr, 1987; Reder & Klatzky, 1993; Schmidt & Bjork, 1992\) leave no doubt that many of the most effective manipulations of training – in terms of post-training retention and transfer – share the property that they introduce difficulties for the learner.*  
*…*  
*If the research picture is so clear, why then are … nonproductive manipulations such common features of real-world training programs? … \[T\]he typical trainer is overexposed, so to speak, to the day-to-day performance and evaluative reactions of his or her trainees. A trainer, in effect, is vulnerable to a type of operant conditioning, where the reinforcing events are improvements in the \[immediate\] performance and/or happiness of trainees.*

*Such a conditioning process, over time, can act to shift the trainer toward manipulations that increase the rate of correct responding – that make the trainee’s life easier, so to speak. Doing that, of course, will move the trainer away from introducing the types of **desirable difficulties** summarized in the preceding section.”*

What’s more, most educational organizations operate in a way that exacerbates this issue:

*“The tendency for instructors to be pushed toward training programs that maximize the performance or evaluative reaction of their trainees during is exacerbated by certain institutional characteristics that are common in real-world organizations.*

*First, those responsible for training are often themselves evaluated in terms of the performance and satisfaction of their trainees during training, or at the end of training.*

*Second, individuals with the day-to-day responsibility for training often do not get a chance to observe the post-training performance of the people they have trained; a trainee’s later successes and failures tend to occur in settings that are far removed from the original training environment, and from the trainer himself or herself.*

*It is also rarely the case that systematic measurements of post-training on-the-job performance are even collected, let alone provided to a trainer as a guide to what manipulations do and do not achieve the post-training goals of training.*

*And, finally, where refresher or retraining programs exist, they are typically the concern of individuals other than those responsible for the original training.”*

### Micro- and Macro-Interleaving {#micro--and-macro-interleaving}

#### | Macro-Interleaving {#|-macro-interleaving}

Math Academy practices interleaving within review and quiz tasks, where students interleave individual practice problems within the learning task. Lessons, on the other hand, involve minimal doses of blocked practice as this is more appropriate when a student is first learning new information.

However, by breaking up our curriculum into a massive number of bite-size, atomic lessons, we implement some degree of interleaving by doing a breadth-first (as opposed to depth-first) learning path through those lessons. We call this **macro-interleaving**, as opposed to **micro-interleaving** (which entails interleaving practice problems within a single learning task).

Most resources don't leverage macro-interleaving. For instance, when learning calculus in a typical school, a class might spend a month on limits, then a month on derivative rules, then a month on integration techniques, then a month on sequences and series – essentially, macro-blocking. The class spends all their time on one unit at a time before declaring it "done" and moving to the next one. To leverage macro-interleaving, it would be better to split up every hour-long class into 15 minutes learning one bite-size topic in each of the 4 categories.

#### | Micro-Interleaving {#|-micro-interleaving}

Math Academy uses macro-interleaving to its fullest extent. The same can be said about micro-interleaving, even though it may not appear that way on the surface.

On the surface, it may appear that micro-interleaving is not fully leveraged when lessons (blocked practice) provide implicit spaced repetition credit towards component skills in need of micro-interleaved review. Shouldn’t every topic receive micro-interleaved review before appearing on a quiz?

However, this is actually the optimal solution to a crucial tradeoff.

* If you want to micro-interleave the problem types within every single topic before seeing them on quizzes, then you have to do an explicit review on every single topic before seeing it on the quiz.

* And if you have to do an explicit review on every single topic, then pretty soon you're going to have way too many reviews and your progress is going to grind to a halt because you're spending all your time reviewing instead of learning new material (this is a common complaint about spaced repetition systems).

So, you have to make a decision: should you

1. fully micro-interleave everything before quizzes, or

2. give up a little bit of micro-interleaving to enable spaced repetition optimizations leading to much faster progress through new material?

If you want to maximize your learning efficiency, the rate at which your learning effort gets transformed into educational progress, then option 2 is better.

Furthermore, in option 2, when engaging in repetition compression, very little micro-interleaving is actually being given up. Reviews micro-interleave not only the problem types in the original lesson, but also the component (prerequisite) skills \-- and reviews are specifically chosen to cover as many component skills as possible that you need practice on, so you'll actually get an outsized dose of micro-interleaving compressed into each review.

## Chapter 20\. The Testing Effect (Retrieval Practice) {#chapter-20.-the-testing-effect-(retrieval-practice)}

***Summary:** The testing effect (or the retrieval practice effect) emphasizes that recalling information from memory, rather than repeated reading, enhances learning. It can be combined with spaced repetition to produce an even more potent learning technique known as spaced retrieval practice. Math Academy leverages the testing effect by continuously assessing students through quick, frequent, quizzes, and encouraging students to solve review problems without referring back to reference material. Measures are taken to reduce anxiety and promote a growth mindset during quizzes.*

### Retrieval is the Most Effective Method of Review {#retrieval-is-the-most-effective-method-of-review}

To maximize the amount by which your memory is extended when solving review problems, it’s necessary to avoid looking back at reference material unless you are totally stuck and cannot remember how to proceed. This is called the [**testing effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect) (also known as the **retrieval practice effect**): the best way to review material is to test yourself on it. As Yang et al. (2023b) [summarize](http://metacog.bnu.edu.cn/pdf/articles/2023/YangLiZhaoLuo2023.pdf):

*“...\[P\]ractice testing (i.e., practice retrieval) is one of the most effective strategies to consolidate long-term retention of studied information and facilitate subsequent learning of new information, a phenomenon labeled the testing effect, the retrieval practice effect, or test-enhanced learning (Carpenter et  al., 2022; Pan & Rickard, 2018; Roediger & Butler, 2011; Shanks et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2021).*

*It has been firmly established that retrieval practice is more beneficial by comparison with many other learning strategies, such as restudying (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b), note-taking (Heitmann et al., 2018; Rummer et al., 2017), concept-mapping (Karpicke & Blunt, 2011\) and other elaborative strategies (Larsen et al., 2013).”*

In other words, the testing effect exposes that "following along" is not the same as learning. Students often mistakenly believe that if they can follow along with a video, book, lecture, or any other resource, without feeling confused, then they're learning. However, if you define learning as a positive change in long-term memory, then you haven't learned unless you’re able to consistently reproduce the information you consumed and use it to solve problems.

This doesn't happen when you just "follow along," even if you understand perfectly. It’s the act of retrieving information from memory that transfers the information to long-term memory. If you don’t practice retrieval, then the information quickly dissipates. It stays with you only briefly – just long enough to trick you into thinking it'll stick with you, when it's really on the way out the door.

Amusingly, the testing effect is one of the oldest cognitive learning strategies known to humankind – records date back as far as 1620, when Francis Bacon [noted](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/bacon1620.pdf) (pp. 76\) the following:

*“...\[Y\]ou won’t learn a passage as well by reading it straight through·twenty times as you will by reading it only ten times and trying each time to recite it from memory and looking at the text only when your memory fails.”*

Since the early 1900s, this observation has been experimentally supported by [hundreds of studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264988491_The_Effect_of_Testing_Versus_Restudy_on_Retention_A_Meta-Analytic_Review_of_the_Testing_Effect) across widely different memory tasks, content domains, and experimental methodologies, which have indicated that the benefits of retrieval practice are caused by increased cognitive effort (Rowland, 2014). In particular, the testing effect has been [shown](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5890758fdccf8e4ea75571f7d8741940660ba38f) to carry over to classroom settings, where frequent quizzing (with feedback) promotes greater learning on both tested *and non-tested* material (McDaniel et al., 2007). Its reliability has even been explicitly [demonstrated](https://journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.82) across individual cognitive differences like working memory capacity (Pastötter & Frings, 2019). As Yang et al. (2023b) [summarize](http://metacog.bnu.edu.cn/pdf/articles/2023/YangLiZhaoLuo2023.pdf):

*“The classroom testing effect generalizes to students across different educational levels (including elementary school, middle school, high school, and university/college), and across 18 subject categories (e.g., Education, Medicine, Psychology, etc.). More importantly, the results showed that classroom quizzes not only benefit retention of factual knowledge, but also promote concept comprehension and facilitate knowledge transfer in the service of solving applied problems. Test-enhanced knowledge transfer has also been observed in many other studies (for a review, see Carpenter, 2012).”*

### Spaced Retrieval Practice {#spaced-retrieval-practice}

What’s more, as Kang (2016) [notes](https://www.teachinghowtolearn.veritytest.com.au/verity/uploads/2021/08/Policy-Insights-from-the-Behavioral-and-Brain-Sciences-2016-Kang-12-9.pdf), the testing effect can be combined with spaced repetition to produce an even more potent learning technique known as **spaced retrieval practice**:

*“Testing or spaced practice, each on its own, confers considerable advantages for learning. But, even better, the two strategies can be combined to amplify the benefits: Reviewing previously studied material can be accomplished through testing (often followed by corrective feedback) instead of rereading.*

*In fact, many studies of the spacing effect compared spaced against massed retrieval practice, not just rereading (e.g., Bahrick, 1979; Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, & Pashler, 2008). Spaced retrieval practice (with feedback) leads to better retention than spaced rereading.*

*One study examined how type of review (reread vs. test with feedback), along with timing of review (massed vs. spaced), affected eighth-grade students’ retention of history facts (Carpenter, Pashler, & Cepeda, 2009). On a final test 9 months later, spaced retrieval practice yielded the highest performance (higher than spaced rereading).”*

As Halpern & Hakel (2003) [elaborate](https://www.mensopschool.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/de-impact-van-lk-op-gemotiveerde-en-ongemotiveerde-lln.pdf):

*“The single most important variable in promoting long-term retention and transfer is ‘practice at retrieval.’ This principle means that learners need to generate responses, with minimal cues, repeatedly over time with varied applications so that recall becomes fluent and is more likely to occur across different contexts and content domains. Simply stated, information that is frequently retrieved becomes more retrievable.*  
*…*  
*The effects of practice at retrieval are necessarily tied to a second robust finding in the learning literature – spaced practice is preferable to massed practice. For example, Bjork and his colleagues recommend spacing the intervals between instances of retrieval so that the time between them becomes increasingly longer – but not so long that retrieval accuracy suffers.”*

And as Yang et al. (2023a, pp.257) [emphasize](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Logan-Fiorella/publication/369588588_Learning_by_Teaching/links/64234a8ca1b72772e431adec/Learning-by-Teaching.pdf#page=260), frequent tests are ideal:

*“Although it has been widely documented that a single test is sufficient to enhance memory compared to restudying, many laboratory studies have observed that repeated tests (i.e., with studied content tested repeatedly) produce a larger enhancing effect on knowledge retention and transfer than a single test (e.g., Butler, 2010; Dunlosky et al., this volume; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b).*

*The enhancing effect of repeated tests has been re-confirmed by many classroom studies. Moreover, Yang et al.’s (2021) metaanalysis coded the number of test repetitions (i.e., how many times the studied information was tested), and conducted analyses to quantify the relation between the magnitude of test-enhanced learning and the number of test (quiz) repetitions. The results showed a clear trend that the more occasions on which class content is quizzed, the more effectively quizzing aids exam performance.**”***

### The Testing Effect is Underused {#the-testing-effect-is-underused}

Unfortunately, the testing effect remains underused in traditional classrooms, where usually only a handful of tests are given throughout the entire duration of a course. As McDaniel et al. (2007) [lament](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=5890758fdccf8e4ea75571f7d8741940660ba38f):

*“...\[D\]espite this impressive body of evidence, the implications of the testing effect literature for educational practice have been virtually ignored by the educational community and educational research.”*

Math Academy, however, leverages the testing effect to its fullest extent by testing frequently as a part of the learning process itself. We implement a form of [**continuous assessment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_assessment) with quick, frequent quizzes, and we also incorporate the testing effect into normal spaced reviews (i.e. *spaced retrieval practice*) by encouraging students to solve problems without referring to worked examples (though they can go back to lesson and dig up a similar example for reference if they really get stuck on a review problem). Even multi-part problems – which pull together many earlier topics to explore a challenging, complex problem context one part at a time – leverage the testing effect by requiring the student to recall each previously-learned skill and apply it to a novel context.

Yet another inefficiency of traditional classrooms is that, in addition to occurring relatively infrequently, tests and quizzes are normally focused around a single set of closely-related topics. As we discussed in the context of interleaving, Math Academy achieves far greater efficiency by selecting a broad mixture of topics – not only on reviews and multi-part problems, but also on assessments. This produces much more forward progress in spaced repetition schedules and also helps students learn to match problems with the appropriate solution techniques.

### Reducing Anxiety and Promoting a Growth Mindset {#reducing-anxiety-and-promoting-a-growth-mindset}

#### | Appropriate vs Inappropriate Usage of Timed Tests {#|-appropriate-vs-inappropriate-usage-of-timed-tests}

Many people view tests, especially timed tests, as anxiety-inducing and consequently something to be avoided. However, it is important to realize that test anxiety can be mitigated, and often even reduced, by giving frequent, low-stakes quizzes on skills that a student is ready to be tested on.

Often, negative feelings toward timed tests are the result of *inappropriate usage* of the timed test, such as introducing it too early in the student’s skill development process. A prerequisite for timed testing is that the student should be able to perform the tested skills successfully in an untimed setting. Timed testing demands a high level of proficiency, and anxiety can be produced if there is a mismatch between a student’s level of proficiency and the performance expectations that are placed on them.

As Codding, Peltier, & Campbell (2023) [summarize](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00400599221121721):

*“Learners may benefit more or less from various instructional strategies or tactics, depending on the learners’ stage of skill development (Burns et al., 2010). That is, are learners working on acquiring a math skill or concept, building skill fluency, generalizing or transferring a skill or concept, or using known skills and concepts to solve novel problems?*

*Just because timed practice opportunities have been proven effective to build fluency, for example, does not mean that timed trials always benefit learners (Fuchs et al., 2021). Using timed trials with students who are working to acquire new knowledge or skills is an instructional mismatch; rather, students need to display accuracy with skills and concepts before building fluency. It is not the fault of the strategy; it is an issue with when to implement the strategy.”*

#### | Desirable vs Undesirable Difficulties {#|-desirable-vs-undesirable-difficulties}

More generally, while desirable difficulties are a necessary component of effective practice, they are only effective insofar as the learner is able to overcome them. Introducing an insurmountable difficulty is never desirable, even if that type of difficulty may be desirable later on in the learning process once the student has increased their proficiency. It is the act of *overcoming* a desirable difficulty that leads to greater learning. As [echoed](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674729018) by Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel (2014, pp.98-99):

*“Elizabeth and Robert Bjork, who coined the phrase ‘desirable difficulties,’ write that difficulties are desirable because ‘they trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and remembering. If, however, the learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become undesirable difficulties.’*  
*…*  
*Clearly, impediments that you cannot overcome are not desirable. … To be desirable, a difficulty must be something learners can overcome through increased effort.”*

As Bjork & Bjork (2023, pp.22) [elaborate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Logan-Fiorella/publication/369588588_Learning_by_Teaching/links/64234a8ca1b72772e431adec/Learning-by-Teaching.pdf#page=26):

*“...\[I\]t is necessary to consider what level of difficulty is appropriate in order for that level to enhance a given student’s learning, and the appropriate level that is optimal may vary considerably based on a student’s background and prior level of knowledge.*

*To illustrate, while it is typically desirable to have learners generate a skill or some knowledge from memory, rather than simply showing them that skill or presenting that knowledge to them, a given learner needs to be equipped via prior learning to succeed at the generation task – or at least succeed in activating relevant aspects of the necessary skill or knowledge – for the act of generating to then potentiate their subsequent practice or study (e.g., Little & Bjork, 2016; Richland, Kornell, & Kao, 2009).”*

Indeed, Codding, VanDerHeyden, & Chehayeb (2023) [found](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07419325231194354) that when the type of instruction is mismatched against a student’s level of proficiency, the instruction will not only be ineffective, but can also lead to anxiety:

*“This study illustrated that when instructional strategies are misaligned with students’ stage of skill development, even when the instructional target is appropriate, students’ math performance will not improve. Furthermore, as suggested in this study, students may exhibit higher levels of anxiety and lower acceptability of misaligned instructional practices.”*

#### | Appropriate Timed Testing Can Reduce Math Anxiety {#|-appropriate-timed-testing-can-reduce-math-anxiety}

However, when used *appropriately*, timed testing can be a valuable tool for overcoming math anxiety by building fluency and automaticity. [According to](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1238887) VanDerHeyden & Codding (2020), who have extensive experience researching academic intervention in mathematics, the relationship between math anxiety and timed testing is unclear, but there is a clear relationship between math anxiety and math proficiency (lower proficiency promotes anxiety, which further hinders skill development), and timed tests are useful for building proficiency:

*“Teachers and parents worry about math anxiety, and some math education experts caution against tactics used in math class, such as timed tasks and tests, that might theoretically stoke anxiety (Boaler, 2012). First, the evidence does not support that people are naturally anxious or not anxious in the context of math assessment and instruction (Hart & Ganley, 2019). Second, simply avoiding math or certain math tactics should not be expected to ameliorate anxiety in the long term. Third, preventing a student from full exposure to math assessment and intervention costs the student the opportunity to develop adaptive coping mechanisms to deal with possible anxiety in the face of challenging academic content.*  
*…*  
*Gunderson, Park, Maloney, Bellock, and Levine (2018) found a reciprocal relationship between skill proficiency and anxiety, such that weak skill reliably preceded anxiety and anxiety further contributed to weak skill development. They found that anxiety could be attenuated by two strategies: improving skill proficiency (this cannot be done by avoiding challenging math work and timed assessment) and promoting a growth mindset (as opposed to a fixed ability mindset) using specific language and instructional arrangements to promote the idea that I, as a student, can work hard and beat my score; I can grow today; my brain is like a muscle that gets stronger when I work it with challenging math content.*  
*…*  
*There is very little empirical evidence examining whether timed tests have a causal impact on anxiety, and the existing few studies that include school-age participants do not support the idea (Grays, Rhymer, & Swartzmiller, 2017; Tsui & Mazzocco, 2006). What is clear is there is a modest, negative bidirectional relationship between math anxiety and math performance (Namkung et al., 2019). These correlational data suggest that poor mathematics performance can lead to high math anxiety and that high math anxiety can lead to poor mathematics performance. The remedy that school psychologists can advocate for is to identify, through effective and efficient screening, the presence of high math anxiety and determine which students would benefit from supplemental and targeted mathematics supports. Intervention approaches should target math skill deficits, address high anxiety, and promote a growth mindset as well as monitor progress toward clearly defined objectives using tools that are brief (often timed), reliable, and valid.”*

These sentiments are [echoed](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/WWC/Docs/PracticeGuide/WWC2021006-Math-PG.pdf#page=58) by the U.S. Department of Education (Fuchs et al., 2021, pp.58), which recommends regularly using timed review activities to promote automatic retrieval of previously-learned material, since students will struggle to learn more advanced material unless they are able to automatically retrieve previously-learned material:

*“Regularly include timed activities as one way to build students’ fluency in mathematics. … \[However,\] Do not use timed activities to introduce and teach mathematics concepts and operations.*  
*…*  
*Quickly retrieving basic arithmetic facts (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) is not easy for students who experience difficulties in mathematics. Without such retrieval, students will struggle to follow their teachers’ explanations of new mathematical ideas. Automatic retrieval gives students more mental energy to understand relatively complex mathematical tasks and execute multistep mathematical procedures.*

*Thus, building automatic fact retrieval in students is one (of many) important goals of intervention. In addition to basic facts, timed activities may address other mathematical subtasks important for solving complex problems.”*

As [summarized](http://metacog.bnu.edu.cn/pdf/articles/2023/YangLiZhaoLuo2023.pdf) by Yang et al. (2023b), quizzes can increase students’ skill proficiency and familiarity with the format of assessment, which can reduce their test anxiety:

*“...\[I\]t is well-known that tests motivate students to study harder (Yang et al., 2017a), encourage them to read the assigned textbook materials to prepare for the lecture (Heiner et al., 2014), reduce mind wandering while learning (Szpunar et al., 2013), and increase class attendance (Schrank, 2016).*

*These beneficial effects of practice tests \[i.e., quizzes\] may make students more prepared for tests and reduce their worry about poor test performance, therefore alleviating TA \[test anxiety\] (Brown & Tallon, 2015; Yusefzadeh et al., 2019). Furthermore, tests may inform students about the formats and contents of future assessments, hence reducing uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty about how and what content will later be assessed) and mitigating anxiety (Jerrell & Betty, 2005).”*

What’s more, as Hattie & Yates (2013, pp.59) [explain](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315885025/visible-learning-science-learn-john-hattie-gregory-yates), performing well on a timed test has been shown to build confidence and promote positive feelings:

*“...\[S\]tudies conducted under laboratory conditions show that, for both adults and children, speed of access in memory functions strongly predicts two other attributes: confidence and positive feelings. Whenever people are able to recall important information quickly there is an inherent sense in that the information is correct, together with a momentary flush of pleasure.”*

Indeed, in a study of thousands of middle and high schoolers’ reactions to frequent (at least weekly), low-stakes, immediate-feedback quizzes during class, Agarwal et al. (2014) [found](https://pdf.retrievalpractice.org/guide/Agarwal_etal_2014_JARMAC.pdf) that most students felt it made them less nervous for higher-stakes tests, and students were more likely to report a decrease in overall test anxiety than an increase:

*“We asked students whether clicker quizzes (i.e., retrieval practice) made them more or less nervous for unit tests and exams … Remarkably, 72% of students reported that retrieval practice made them less nervous for tests and exams, 22% said they experienced about the same level of nervousness, and only 6% of students said clickers made them more nervous.*

*Next, we asked students whether they experienced more, less, or about the same level of test anxiety for the class with retrieval practice compared to other classes in which they did not have retrieval practice … \[O\]nly 19% of students reported experiencing more anxiety, while 81% of students said they experienced about the same level of test anxiety or less in the class with retrieval practice compared to their other classes (33% reported less nervousness).*  
*…*  
*\[T\]he use of clicker response systems reduced self-reported test anxiety. … We hypothesize that students became familiar with taking quizzes, knew the course material better, and hence were less anxious when facing the unit test on which they would receive a grade.”*

As [echoed](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Logan-Fiorella/publication/369588588_Learning_by_Teaching/links/64234a8ca1b72772e431adec/Learning-by-Teaching.pdf#page=260) by Yang et al. (2023a):

*“...\[F\]requent testing has little impact on or even reduces (rather than increases) test anxiety. For instance, in a large sample study (over 1,000 college participants), Yang et al. (2020) observed that interpolating tests across a study phase has minimal influence on participants’ test anxiety. Szpunar et al. (2013) found that frequent tests significantly relieve test anxiety (for related findings, see Khanna, 2015). Furthermore, in a large-scale survey conducted by Agarwal et al. (2014), 72% of 1,306 middle and 102 high school students reported that frequent quizzes made them less anxious about exams, with only 8% reporting the opposite.”*

In a separate [meta-analysis](http://metacog.bnu.edu.cn/pdf/articles/2023/YangLiZhaoLuo2023.pdf), Yang et al. (2023b) summarized some other empirical studies observing that quizzes reduced test anxiety:

*“...\[I\]n a quasi-experimental study conducted by Piroozmanesh and Imanipour (2018), two classes of nursing undergraduates took a coronary care course, with the experimental class taking class quizzes across the semester, whereas the control class did not take these quizzes. For both classes, students’ TA was measured at the beginning of the semester (pretest) and one week before the final exam (posttest). The results showed that although there was minimal difference in TA during the pretest between the two classes, students in the experimental class were much less anxious before the final exam than those in the control class.*   
*…*  
*Szpunar et  al. (2013) obtained consistent findings. Specifically, after both the test and the no-test group completed the interim test on Segment 4, both groups were told that they would take a cumulative test on all four segments and were instructed to report how anxious they were about the cumulative test. Consistent with the findings from Piroozmanesh and Imanipour (2018) and Brown and Tallon (2015), Szpunar et al. (2013) observed that participants in the test group were much less anxious than those in the no-test group.”*

The meta-analysis, which included 24 studies across thousands of participants, ultimately concluded that quizzes reduce test anxiety about as much as they increase academic performance (in both cases, a medium effect size of about 0.5).

*“The current review integrates results across 24 studies (i.e., 25 effects based on 3,374 participants) to determine the effect of practice tests (quizzes) on test anxiety (TA) and explore potential moderators of the effect. The results show strong Bayesian evidence (BF10\>25,000) that practice tests appreciably reduce TA to a medium extent (Hedges’ g=-0.52), with minimal evidence of publication bias.*  
*…*  
*In a recent meta-analytic review, Yang et al. (2021) integrated data from over 48,000 students, extracted from 222 classroom studies, to determine whether class quizzes improve students’ academic performance. The answer is affirmative: Class quizzes enhance students’ academic attainment to a medium extent (Hedges’ g=0.50).”*

#### | Implementing Appropriate Timed Testing {#|-implementing-appropriate-timed-testing}

Granted, in a traditional classroom, it is difficult to keep instructional practices aligned to student proficiencies because each student develops their skills at a different rate. For any given skill, at any given time, some students may be ready for timed testing while others may need additional practice – but the teacher generally does not have enough bandwidth to manage different learning tasks for different students on different skills, and the best they can do is provide learning tasks that feel appropriate for the class “on average.” Of course, those learning tasks will be inappropriate for some students and may lead to decreased learning and increased anxiety.

Math Academy, however, adapts the level of instruction to each individual student on each individual skill. Students initially learn skills during highly-scaffolded lessons, where they are given as much practice as they need to master the skills. Only after they demonstrate their ability to perform the skills do they begin seeing those skills on higher-intensity forms of practice like timed quizzes.

The quizzes are low-stakes and frequent, and are structured in a way that promotes an “I can do this” growth mindset. Whenever a student misses a question on a quiz, they receive a remedial review on the corresponding topic so that they can increase their proficiency in that area. If a student does less than “well” on a quiz, then they are also given the opportunity to retake the quiz to demonstrate their improved proficiency. The goal is not only to give students realistic feedback about their skill proficiency, but also to demonstrate to students that they can improve their proficiency by putting forth effort on their learning tasks.

  ***Importance:** Often, negative feelings toward timed tests are the result of inappropriate usage of the timed test, such as introducing it too early in the student’s skill development process. A prerequisite for timed testing is that the student should be able to perform the tested skills successfully in an untimed setting. Timed testing demands a high level of proficiency, and anxiety can be produced if there is a mismatch between a student’s level of proficiency and the performance expectations that are placed on them.*

## Chapter 21\. Targeted Remediation {#chapter-21.-targeted-remediation}

***Summary:** Math Academy provides automated, precise support to help students strengthen weaknesses on specific topics or component skills that are personal sources of struggle. The bar for success is never lowered; rather, students are given additional practice that helps them clear the bar fully and independently on their next attempt.*

### High-Granularity, High-Integrity Remediation {#high-granularity,-high-integrity-remediation}

In the academic literature, the term *targeted remediation* usually describes identifying individual students in need of broad remedial intervention such as tutoring, remedial courses, academic advisor meetings, etc.

But in the context of Math Academy, **targeted remediation** refers to fully-automated support mechanisms that are targeted to individual students *on individual topics* – and often even more precisely to the individual component skills that are causing a student to struggle on a topic.

Math Academy’s targeted remediation is different from the concept of *adaptive feedback* in intelligent tutoring systems, which the [*Handbook of Learning Analytics*](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dragan-Gasevic/publication/324687610_Handbook_of_Learning_Analytics/links/5add21e1aca272fdaf86c95c/Handbook-of-Learning-Analytics.pdf) describes as providing hints to the learner or recommendations for the instructional designer to better match a task to students’ abilities (Pardo et al., 2017, pp.166):

*“A large portion of the studies related to adaptive feedback have been developed through … systems that provide a set of learning tasks to students in specific knowledge domains. … the system commonly offers various types of task-level feedback, such as next-step hints (e.g., Peddycord, Hicks, & Barnes, 2014); correctness hints, also known as flag feedback (Barker-Plummer, Cox, & Dale, 2011); positive or encouraging hints (Stefanescu, Rus, & Graesser, 2014); recommendations on next steps or tasks \[not for the students, but for the instructional designer to better match the task to students’ abilities\] (Ben-Naim, Bain, & Marcus, 2009); or various combinations of the above.”*

Unlike the forms of adaptive feedback described above, which effectively lower the bar for success on the learning task, Math Academy’s targeted remediation mechanisms keep the bar where it’s at. Instead, we focus on actions that are most likely to strengthen a student’s area of weakness and empower them to clear the bar fully and independently on their next attempt.

To our best knowledge, targeted remediation at Math Academy’s level of **granularity** (individual students on individual topics) and **integrity** (maintaining the bar for success) has not been studied in academic literature.

As stated by the [handbook](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dragan-Gasevic/publication/324687610_Handbook_of_Learning_Analytics/links/5add21e1aca272fdaf86c95c/Handbook-of-Learning-Analytics.pdf) (Pardo et al., 2017, pp.168):

*“A dearth of research explores how students interact with and are transformed by algorithm-produced feedback. Furthermore, the relationship between the type of interventions that can be derived from data analysis and adequate forms of feedback remains inadequately explored.”*

This may be for reasons of academic infeasibility: the expense (both time and money) to develop an automated learning system is large and increases proportionally with the granularity of the curriculum, making it a rather industrial endeavor.

### Corrective Remediation {#corrective-remediation}

When students struggle, we follow up with [**corrective**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_action) **remedial support** that is **targeted** to their specific point of struggle.

* If they struggle during a task, we give more questions – that is, more chances to learn and demonstrate their learning.

* If they fail a lesson, we give them a break and enable them to make progress learning unrelated topics before asking them to re-attempt the failed lesson. Usually, all it takes to rebound is a bit of rest and a fresh pair of eyes. On average, students pass their first attempt 95% of the time, and within two attempts 99% of the time, without any further intervention. 

* However, if we detect that they get stuck again in the same place in a lesson, without making any additional forward progress, we give them **remedial reviews** to help them strengthen their foundations in the areas most relevant to their point of struggle.

* Whenever they miss a question on a quiz, we immediately follow up with a remedial review on the corresponding topic.

One challenge in properly targeting remedial reviews is that often, the key prerequisite concepts or skills required to solve a particular problem lie several steps back in the hierarchy of mathematical knowledge. However, when developing our content and building our knowledge graph, we explicitly keep track of the **key prerequisites** that are used in each part of each lesson. This allows us to pinpoint the exact topics that are necessary for successful remediation.

As a concrete example, suppose that while re-attempting the lesson *Exponents with Rational Bases*, a student

* manages to pass *Part 1: Expressing a Product Using an Exponent*, e.g. expressing 4 × 4 × 4 as 43 , but

* gets stuck again at *Part 2: Evaluating an Exponential Expression*, e.g. computing (–4)3 \= (–4) × (–4) × (–4).


In this situation, the student has demonstrated that they understand the concept of an exponent, but they are struggling to use multiplication to compute the result.

Although multiplication occurs several steps back in the sequence of prerequisites, we have linked *Part 2: Evaluating an Exponential Expression* to the key prerequisite topic *Multiplying Negative Numbers*, which allows us to automatically trigger a targeted remedial review on *Multiplying Negative Numbers*.

![][image13]

### Preventative Remediation {#preventative-remediation}

We also attempt to predict struggle beforehand and leverage [**preventative**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_action) **remediation** to avoid the struggle entirely. Conveniently, this happens naturally when we tailor the spaced repetition process to individual student-topic learning speeds.

The initial starting value of a student-topic learning speed is a prediction of how difficult that topic is going to be for the given student. The prediction is primarily based on learning speeds of other related topics – so if the predicted learning speed is low (i.e. we predict that the student is going to struggle on the topic), then it is low because one or more of the other related topics has a low learning speed.

Those other related topics with low learning speed are the predicted points of failure in the student’s predicted struggle, we are already performing preventative remediation on them by slowing down their spaced repetition processes and forcing explicit reviews. In other words, “post”-remediation of earlier topics naturally functions as “pre”-remediation for later topics.

### Foundational Remediation {#foundational-remediation}

Math Academy’s diagnostics are tailored to specific courses – but in addition to assessing knowledge of course content, they also assess knowledge of lower-grade **foundations** that students need to know in order to succeed in the course (i.e. they are prerequisites for the course).

For instance, students need to know plenty of arithmetic in order to solve problems in algebra. So, the foundations of algebra include those necessary topics from arithmetic. Likewise, the foundations of calculus include plenty of algebra and also some geometry, and the foundations of most university-level courses (such as multivariable calculus) include plenty of single-variable calculus and precalculus.

It is common for incoming students to lack some foundational knowledge that is necessary to succeed in their chosen course. While this could spell doom in a traditional classroom, Math Academy is able to estimate a student’s knowledge frontier *even if it is below their course*, and help them fill in any missing foundational knowledge while simultaneously allowing them to learn course topics that don’t rely on that missing foundational knowledge.

![][image53]

Math Academy also optimizes the timing of when to have students begin shoring up their missing foundations. Students are generally more excited to work on topics in the course that they are enrolled in, than they are to shore up missing foundations – and students tend to be more productive and consistent when they’re excited about what they’re doing. So, we allow students to start out completing the topics in their enrolled course that don’t depend on their missing foundations. This helps students build up some momentum, make some progress towards their primary goal, and get into a habit of frequent learning. Once a student reaches the point where they need to shore up missing foundations in order to continue making progress in their enrolled course, they have built up plenty of momentum that will help carry them through the process of foundational remediation and make them far less likely to get discouraged and quit.

### Content Remediation {#content-remediation}

As a mastery learning system, Math Academy holds its students accountable for learning – and in return, our students hold us accountable for providing material that is properly scaffolded and easy to learn from. If there is ever a topic that more than a tiny percentage of students struggle with, then we see it as an indication that we need to not only remediate the students, but also remediate our own content.

We take **content remediation** extremely seriously. Math Academy is like a tutor whose livelihood depends on the actual learning outcomes of its students – unlike many other learning platforms (and even many human teachers) that let students move on to more advanced content despite poor performance on prerequisite content. If a student can’t succeed in mastering the material that we ask them to learn, then we are out of a job.

To help us remediate our content, we have developed learning analytics tools that allow us to analyze the performance of any piece of content, at any level of granularity: not just individual topics, but also each individual knowledge point within a topic, and each individual question within a knowledge point.

If the pass rate for any lesson is unacceptably low, we can pinpoint the exact knowledge point(s) within that topic where students are getting stuck, as well as any particular questions within that knowledge point that are causing issues.

By continually refining our content and algorithms over the course of many years, we have reached the point that **our students pass lessons 95% of the time on the first try and 99% of the time within two tries.** As we continue refining our content into the future, these pass rates will continue to increase.

It’s worth emphasizing that when we refine and remediate our own content, we do **not** lower standards. The way we raise pass rates is by introducing more scaffolding into lessons to further reduce cognitive load. Sometimes this means improving the way a concept or worked example is explained; other times it means adding an intermediate knowledge point to a lesson, or occasionally even splitting an entire topic into two or more different topics that more specifically address different contexts of the original topic.

## Chapter 22\. Gamification {#chapter-22.-gamification}

***Summary:** Gamification, integrating game-like elements into learning environments, proves effective in increasing student learning, engagement, and enjoyment. Math Academy utilizes eXperience Points (XP) to gamify learning, incentivizing both quantity and quality of work. XP awards bonus points for stellar performance and introduces penalties for poor efforts, preventing exploitation by adversarial students. Math Academy also remedies loopholes that are typically found (and exploited) in traditional classrooms.*

### Importance of Gamification {#importance-of-gamification}

#### | Increasing Learning, Engagement, and Enjoyment {#|-increasing-learning,-engagement,-and-enjoyment}

A common theme across many of the cognitive learning strategies described in this document has been that they produce more learning by increasing cognitive activation, which students find less enjoyable because it’s more mentally taxing. Furthering the inconvenience, students often *mistakenly* interpret extra cognitive effort as an indication that they are not learning as well, when in fact the opposite is true.

Thankfully, the strategy of [**gamification**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) behaves differently. Numerous studies have shown that when game-like elements (such as points and leaderboards) are integrated into student learning environments in ways that are

1. aligned with the goals of a course, the motivations of the students, and the context of the educational setting, and

2. robust to “hacking” or “gaming the system” (i.e. behaviors that attempt to bypass learning by exploiting loopholes in the rules of the game),  
   

students typically not only [learn](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1747938X19302908) more and [engage](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173403) more with the content, but also [enjoy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcal.12664) it more (Bai, Hew, & Huang, 2020; Looyestyn et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2022).

This applies not only to young students, but also to university-level students and even postgraduate students in technically-challenging courses. As the authors of a gamification study at Delft University of Technology [describe](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandru-Iosup/publication/262395542_An_experience_report_on_using_gamification_in_technical_higher_education/links/544f9f240cf2bca5ce92aa8f/An-experience-report-on-using-gamification-in-technical-higher-education.pdf) (Iosup & Epema, 2014):

*“Over the past three years, we have applied gamification to undergraduate and graduate courses in a leading technical university in the Netherlands and in Europe. Ours is one of the first long-running attempts to show that gamification can be used to teach technically challenging courses.*

*The two gamification-based courses, the first-year B.Sc. course Computer Organization and an M.Sc.-level course on the emerging technology of Cloud Computing, have been cumulatively followed by over 450 students and passed by over 75% of them, at the first attempt.*

*We find that gamification is correlated with an increase in the percentage of passing students, and in the participation in voluntary activities and challenging assignments. Gamification seems to also foster interaction in the classroom and trigger students to pay more attention to the design of the course. We also observe very positive student assessments and volunteered testimonials, and a Teacher of the Year award.”*

#### | Increasing Learning Efficiency {#|-increasing-learning-efficiency}

Clearly, gamification is a potent strategy for maintaining student motivation and helping students feel good about hard work. (Any readers with experience in high-performance athletics will know the wonders that a bit of gamification can do for maintaining morale while working hard at practice – usually in the form of tracking personal progress or engaging in friendly competition with teammates.)

But even more importantly, gamification also functions as a lever by which to incentivize high-quality work. Because adaptive learning systems like Math Academy speed up or slow down based on student performance, a student’s **learning efficiency** depends highly on the quality of their work:

* a student who performs well can make a lot of progress in a course by doing a relatively small amount of work, while

* a student who performs poorly will have to do significantly more work to make the same amount of progress.

In effect, for a student to make educational progress in an adaptive learning system like Math Academy, they have to put forth a sufficient amount of high-quality work.

### Incentivizing Quantity and Quality of Work {#incentivizing-quantity-and-quality-of-work}

#### | XP-Time Equivalence {#|-xp-time-equivalence}

To incentivize both quantity and quality of work, Math Academy uses **eXperience Points (XP)** to implement a gamified reward system. Students earn XP upon successful completion of learning tasks, and XP is calibrated so that 1 XP represents 1 minute of fully-focused, fully-productive work for an average serious (but imperfect) student.

![][image54]

XP makes it easy for parents and teachers to set reasonable learning goals as a daily target number of XP, and it gives the system a lever by which to incentivize student behavior that is beneficial to learning.

![][image55]

#### | Incentivizing Quantity of Work {#|-incentivizing-quantity-of-work}

For instance, to incentivize students to put forth a sufficient quantity of work, we implemented (optional) **competitive weekly leaderboards** where students are grouped into smaller **leagues** with other students of similar competitive ability**.** If a student earns enough XP to end the week near the top of their league, they promote to a higher league. But if they end the week near the bottom of their league, they demote to a lower league.

![][image56]

#### | Incentivizing Quality of Work {#|-incentivizing-quality-of-work}

Likewise, to incentivize students to maintain high quality of work, we scale XP awards so that there is a large reward for doing a stellar job (as opposed to just “good enough”), and students must clear a bar in order to earn any XP. This stands in contrast to traditional aggregate-percentage grades, which provide minimal reward for going above and beyond while simultaneously often allowing students to “get by” with poor performance.

XP allows us to implement a “carrot and stick” approach to incentivizing student effort: we award

* bonus XP for perfect performance – awarding bonus points for high performance has been [shown](https://library2.smu.ca/bitstream/handle/01/22155/clarke_engram_deborah_p_masters_1979.PDF?sequence=1) to increase performance (Egram, 1979),

* full XP for nearly perfect performance,

* most XP for otherwise passable performance,

* a little XP for nearly passable performance,

* zero XP for poor performance, and

* a negative XP penalty for blowing off a task.

![][image57]

### Closing Loopholes {#closing-loopholes}

Most students use Math Academy properly and therefore rarely (if ever) see XP penalties. However, we have experienced on numerous occasions that in the absence of a penalty system, adversarial students will complete tasks that they feel are easy and then submit random guesses to intentionally fail out of tasks that require more effort. This tanks their performance, causing their adaptive learning schedule to slow down or even begin falling backwards, which drastically slows or even prevents progress towards their educational goals.

We call these students “XP hackers.” They engage in this behavior because they are trying to minimize their effort per XP. Without XP penalties, the XP hacker strategy can be exploited indefinitely and students can rack up XP without making progress.

As Baker et al. (2006) [noted](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~listen/pdfs/Baker175.pdf), a way to prevent adversarial students from gaming the system is to tweak the rules in a way that *“change\[s\] the incentive to game – whereas gaming might previously have been seen as a way to avoid work, it now leads to extra work.”* In our case, this means taking away some XP whenever a student blows off a task (and even more XP if they continue blowing off tasks). By introducing a penalty, we tweak the game so that the way to minimize effort per XP is to give a legitimate effort on every task.

In order to trigger and calibrate XP penalties appropriately, we interpret penalties as conveying how frustrated a teacher, tutor, or guardian sitting next to the student would become. After implementing XP penalties, we found that many adversarial students’ rates of passing learning tasks jumped from under 50% to over 90%, while students who used the system properly and truly gave their best effort rarely (if ever) experienced penalties.

Math Academy also remedies loopholes that are typically found (and exploited) in traditional classrooms. For instance, the most obvious enabler of cheating in traditional classrooms is giving all students the same homework and assessments. But Math Academy customizes its learning path to each individual student, so it’s unusual for classmates to have the opportunity to work on the same topic at the same time – and even if they do, then they are served different questions, since we have a large bank of questions for each topic. Our assessments are also fully individualized and even randomized, meaning that there is absolutely no edge that a student can gain from seeing a classmate’s quiz. And if a student fails a task and has to re-attempt it, we change up the questions and even wait for a delay period before allowing the re-attempt (in the meantime, the student is able to continue making progress along other learning paths).

### Progress vs XP {#progress-vs-xp}

It’s important to realize that a student’s progress (percent of topics completed) in a course is highly correlated with, but fundamentally different from, the amount of XP that they have earned in the course. The only time a student's progress percent increases is when they complete a lesson. As a student gets further into their course (and math in general), more review is required to maintain their growing knowledge base. As a result, students make progress faster at the beginning of a course than they do at the end of a course.

![][image58]

Progress is nonlinear. Students make progress very quickly at the beginning of a course because they can focus primarily on learning new topics (i.e. lessons) as opposed to maintaining existing knowledge (i.e. reviews). But the more they learn, the more there is to review – so progress slows down. That said, we have a hard rule to ensure that on average, students have the opportunity to work on a lesson at least \~25% of the time or so at a minimum.

At surface level, it might seem like it would be more straightforward to measure progress in terms of XP completed relative to the total estimated XP in the course. However, this would create issues because the amount of XP in a course can change significantly in response to changes in student performance (because the spaced repetition process speeds up when students are doing well and slows down when students are struggling). If progress were measured in terms of XP, then a student could run into a situation where they are completing lessons but their progress is going down because their overall performance is decreasing, which would be far more counterintuitive and confusing.

It is also worth noting that progress naturally slow downs at the end of a course, when a student only has a handful of topics remaining. Often, when we give a student a new lesson, we are actually knocking out one or more due reviews with that lesson. The more lessons are on the student’s "knowledge frontier," the more likely it is that we can find a new lesson to knock out some due reviews. The flipside is that when a student only has a handful of lessons left in a course, it severely restricts our ability to carry out this sort of optimization. To be clear, the system is not moving slowly in an absolute sense, just “less fast” relative to the normal turbo-boosted behavior, because it is unable to take advantage of a strategy that it normally uses to turbo-boost the rate at which students can make progress.

While this constraint can be circumvented by allowing the system to receive topics from the next course (that knock out some currently-due reviews) once they are in the last handful of topics of a course, that would lead to confusion, and in the big picture it would just be a micro-optimization that has negligible impact on total XP per course.

## Chapter 23\. Leveraging Cognitive Learning Strategies Requires Technology {#chapter-23.-leveraging-cognitive-learning-strategies-requires-technology}

***Summary:** While there is plenty of room for teachers to make better use of cognitive learning strategies in the classroom, teachers are victims of circumstance in a profession lacking effective accountability and incentive structures, and the end result is that students continue to receive mediocre educational experiences. Given a sufficient degree of accountability and incentives, there is no law of physics preventing a teacher from putting forth the work needed to deliver an optimal learning experience to a single student. However, in the absence of technology, it is impossible for a single human teacher to deliver an optimal learning experience to a classroom of many students with heterogeneous knowledge profiles, each of whom needs to work on different types of problems and receive immediate feedback on each of their attempts. This is why technology is necessary. By automatically leveraging cognitive learning strategies to their fullest extent, Math Academy is able to deliver an optimized, adaptive, personalized learning experience to each individual student. Math Academy students are perpetually engaged in productive problem-solving, with immediate feedback (and remediation when necessary), on the specific types of problems (and in the specific types of settings) that will move the needle the most for their personal learning progress.*

### High-Level Context {#high-level-context}

#### | The Problem: Cognitive Learning Strategies Remain Underused {#|-the-problem:-cognitive-learning-strategies-remain-underused}

It is common knowledge among researchers that the cognitive learning strategies discussed in previous chapters have the potential to drastically improve the depth, pace, and overall success of student learning. These strategies have been identified and researched extensively since the early to mid-1900s, with key findings being successfully reproduced over and over again since then. However, as discussed in [chapter 2](#bookmark=id.cyfxx290tej7), the disappointing reality is that the practice of education has barely changed, and in many ways remains in direct opposition to these strategies.

#### | The Blame: Teachers are Victims of Circumstance {#|-the-blame:-teachers-are-victims-of-circumstance}

So, what happened? Why does the potential of these cognitive learning strategies remain unrealized, and who – or what – is to blame?

We do not wish to direct the blame at teachers. For instance, one cannot blame [Sherman (1992)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279650/pdf/jaba00015-0061.pdf) – who did everything in his power to leverage mastery-based learning within his own classroom and promote its widespread adoption – for having his efforts opposed and ultimately overpowered by various forces at play within the education system. Likewise, one cannot blame other teachers who have thought about ways to capitalize on these cognitive learning strategies to improve student learning, but, for one reason or another, found it too difficult to integrate them into their classroom in practice.

Teachers are victims of circumstance. The education system – like any other system whose intended function (promoting learning) is limited by the scarce resources (teachers and funding) available to achieve that function – has developed its own conventions while seeking the closest thing to a solution to an intractable problem. As the education system has evolved over hundreds of years, these conventions have accumulated and ossified into hard-baked constraints that outlive their usefulness. Many constraints are no longer helpful to the goal of promoting learning, yet remain deeply ingrained and act to resist change.

As [summarized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279650/pdf/jaba00015-0061.pdf) by Sherman (1992):

*“...\[T\]he investment in keeping things as they are may be impossible to overcome. … Improving instruction is the goal, but only in the context of not changing anything that is important to any vested interest. … \[When the role of the teacher\] does not conform to what most people think of as teaching; this is a problem and an obstacle to implementation.”*

#### | The Solution: Technology Changes Everything {#|-the-solution:-technology-changes-everything}

In the past, scarcity of resources (teachers and funding) has made it impossible to fully leverage cognitive learning strategies in traditional classrooms. This scarcity persists today. However, a new variable has also entered the equation: technology. 

Technology changes everything. Individualized digital learning environments are now technologically possible and commercially viable. Technology not only lets us circumvent the opposing inertia in the education system, but also helps us leverage cognitive learning strategies to a degree that would not be feasible for even the most agreeable and hard-working human teacher. 

### Resistance to Additional Effort {#resistance-to-additional-effort}

One force keeping cognitive learning strategies out of the classroom is that they require additional effort from teachers and students. Again, we do not say this with the intent to cast blame – it is simply a fact that as humans, we tend to resist additional effort, especially when we (like teachers) are already tired or (like young students) do not fully understand the long-term consequences of our decisions.

Teachers are already under a high level of baseline stress while facing strenuous – and often conflicting – demands from administrators, parents, and students. When it comes to promoting learning, teachers can keep all parties satisfied (or, perhaps, not too dissatisfied) by checking the boxes on long-standing conventions of the educational system: some lectures, some homework, several quizzes, and a couple tests. There’s only so much you can deride a teacher for meeting the societal and institutional expectations that are placed on them, but not going above and beyond.

The same applies to students. Like a child who prefers to eat junk food and watch TV, but manages to complete their chores and eat the vegetables on their dinner plate, there’s only so much you can deride a student for showing up to class, being undisruptive, and performing well enough on homework and tests to earn a passing grade, but not going above and beyond to maximize their learning and retention – especially when they are too young to fully grasp the long-term impact of their present habits on their future life.

Additionally, it is unreasonable to expect students to be highly motivated to maximize their learning in every subject when a reality of human nature is that most people are unmotivated to do most things. The tiny subset of things that a person is motivated to do in life are called their career and hobbies, and most people only have at most one career and a few hobbies. Everything else – i.e., the vast majority of things – are chores.

#### | Active Learning {#|-active-learning}

Active learning requires teachers to spend more time and effort preparing and managing classroom activities. As we emphasized in [chapter 10](#bookmark=id.1al4cded0jxy), true active learning requires every individual student to be actively engaged on every piece of material to be learned.

To implement true active learning in a math classroom, a teacher must continually supply problems, enforce that each student is attempting the problems, and check each student’s solution to each problem, providing corrective feedback whenever a solution is incorrect. Enforcing that students are doing the problems can be particularly difficult and frustrating, since all but the most motivated students will typically avoid mentally taxing work when possible. (While it’s true that more students may become motivated to put forth a high level of effort and maintain it in the absence of supervision if they enter a state of flow, there is typically an initial “activation energy” that must be overcome before reaching the flow experience, similar to how one might not look forward to working out but actually have a lot of fun and feel proud of their effort once they get going with it.)

Additionally, active learning requires the teacher to make lots of on-the-fly decisions, which can feel overwhelming to teachers who are more comfortable planning everything out beforehand. What the class does next should depend on whether students were able to do what the teacher originally asked them to do. These decisions can get especially tricky when the class becomes “split” with many students being able to do the original activity and being ready to move on to something more challenging, but many other students struggling and needing more practice (or even remedial support) with the original activity. No active learning lesson plan survives contact with a class full of students of varying abilities.

On the whole, it’s way easier for a teacher to just talk and write on the board and “check the box” on active learning (without really leveraging it) by making sure that students appear to be listening, having some discussion with the smartest kids in the class, and maybe displaying a few problems and asking who wants to come up to the board to present a solution.

#### | Non-Interference, Interleaving, and Spaced Repetition {#|-non-interference,-interleaving,-and-spaced-repetition}

##### \> Shuffling Instructional Material {#>-shuffling-instructional-material}

As discussed in [chapter 17](#bookmark=id.p16l8c507ouh), conceptually related pieces of knowledge can interfere with each other’s recall, especially when taught simultaneously or in close succession. To minimize the impact of interference, new concepts should be taught alongside dissimilar material. However, it is easier for teachers to work in batch, creating week-by-week class lesson plans around groups of related material.

Additionally, the instructional material that’s provided to teachers is typically structured around curricular units of related content. While it may make sense to structure a reference book this way (for ease of lookup), this organization does not reflect the optimal order to actually teach the material. As a result, a teacher wishing to leverage non-interference would have to invest additional time and effort into “shuffling” their instructional material while ensuring that every topic comes later than its prerequisites in the shuffled order.

Similar effort is required to leverage interleaving, which, as discussed in [chapter 18](#bookmark=id.ea0eymbgwal4), involves spreading out review problems over multiple review assignments that each cover a broad mix of previously-learned topics. Most textbooks are structured the opposite way – in blocks, where a single skill is practiced many times consecutively. As a result, a teacher typically cannot just grab an interleaved assignment “off the shelf” – rather, they will need to invest time and effort to manually allocate problems across interleaved assignments and keep track of how much practice they’ve given the class on each topic.

##### \> Opening a Can of Worms on Forgetting {#>-opening-a-can-of-worms-on-forgetting}

Interleaving can open a can of worms on who doesn’t remember what: when students are doing a variety of different things and are not able to mindlessly apply one type of procedure to one type of problem, they may need reminders of how and when to apply various solution techniques, they may make a variety of different types of mistakes, and they may have scattered questions in class the next day about the previous day’s homework. The same thing happens during spaced repetition, which, as discussed in [chapter 18](#bookmark=id.7fkp59khmotz), involves spacing out reviews over time.

Opening this can of worms is actually a good thing because it provides an immense amount of information about what each student needs to work on – but it can feel overwhelming for teachers to have so many student needs at one time, especially when the teacher is under pressure for the class to cover a set amount of content by a fixed deadline, and the teacher feels like remediating student forgetting is “slowing down” their progress towards that goal.

Of course, good teachers understand the importance of continual review and periodically revisit previously-learned material to help their students retain it. However, as discussed in [chapter 18](#bookmark=id.7fkp59khmotz), optimizing retention through true spaced repetition requires a massive, inhuman amount of bookkeeping and computation. Carrying out even a loose approximation of spaced repetition for the class as a whole requires an immense level of effort. Given the additional stress that continual review creates for teachers, it’s easier to just stick to the status quo and cram a class or two of review before each major test.

#### | Testing Effect {#|-testing-effect}

Good, highly-engaged teachers understand the importance of quizzes and give regular weekly or biweekly quizzes (which is reasonably frequent, though a higher frequency would be ideal). However, unless these quizzes are built into some existing curriculum that they are working from, it takes a lot of work to create those quizzes, grade them, and go over mistakes with students. And that’s not all:

* Ideally, students who don’t do so well will be given the opportunity to demonstrate learning from their mistakes on a retake quiz with different (but similar) questions – which effectively doubles the teacher’s workload relating to quizzes.

* In a class of more than a handful of students, there is always a good chance that one or more students will be absent due to sickness, medical appointments, or other things, in which case the teacher has to schedule make-up quizzes.

* Especially at the high school and university levels, a minority of students may cause further headache by routinely complaining that questions they missed were unfair (and should be thrown out) or begging for undeserved partial credit.

Considering that most full-time teachers teach about 5-6 different classes each day, it’s an infeasible amount of work to quiz students every few days. Giving regular weekly or biweekly quizzes in all of one’s classes is hard enough. Realistically, given the additional stress that teachers experience when they give additional quizzes, it’s easier to just stick to the status quo and quiz students at the bare minimum frequency required to meet one’s professional expectations.

#### | Gamification {#|-gamification}

Managing a gamified metric like eXperience Points (XP), and other gamified features like leaderboards, takes an immense amount of bookkeeping. It can be done, but it takes a really engaged teacher, and even then, it’s typically too much work for a teacher to integrate every single learning task into the gamification structure. Gamification is typically not a part of a teacher’s professional expectations, so it’s easier for teachers to just forego it.

### Tutoring the King’s Kid: How Would You Teach if Your Life Depended On It? {#tutoring-the-king’s-kid:-how-would-you-teach-if-your-life-depended-on-it?}

The issues described above are not impossible to overcome manually. Each issue is solvable, but the solution requires a lot of work from the teacher. There is no law of physics preventing the teacher from putting forth that work, but the degree of accountability and incentives in place is not sufficient to motivate the teacher to do so.

(We again emphasize that this is not the fault of teachers, who are victims of circumstance in a profession lacking effective accountability and incentive structures. Who wants to work harder than necessary if they know they’re not going to be rewarded for it, and there is no punishment for mediocre work? Nobody.)

To intuitively understand the importance of accountability and incentives, it may help to imagine yourself as an educator in a life-or-death situation, where the outcome of the situation depends on whether you can teach a student effectively enough that they are able to unequivocally demonstrate their learning to a third party. Below is a retelling of Jason Roberts's *Tutoring the King's Kid* anecdote:

*Suppose that you are an educator back in medieval times, and you work within the kingdom of the wealthiest, but also the fiercest, king in all the world. The king’s child has participated in a school within the kingdom, but the king has been unhappy with the results: the child has gone to school for over a year, and has learned how to count, but remains unable to solve any problem requiring simple application of arithmetic.*

*One day, the king sends for you to appear immediately at his throne. When you show up, he commands you to teach simple arithmetic to his child as your sole duty for the next month. The child shall spend the entirety of each school day with you, and in exactly one month, the king shall ask his child five questions, each one requiring the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two numbers, each number being one or two digits long. The child will have two minutes to complete each question, and their performance on this test will determine your fate.*

*Being the wealthiest king in all the world, he has decided that if the child answers at least four of the five questions correctly, then he will grant you a fortune so extravagant that you can live out the rest of your life to the same level of luxury as a lesser king. However, if the child answers three or fewer questions correctly, then you shall be executed the following day.*

In this situation, you’re motivated to put in the work to overcome each of the issues described earlier. The instructional experience becomes entirely student-centered, leveraging cognitive learning strategies as much as humanly possible.

*Suddenly, you realize that you don’t care at all about how much time, effort, and stress you have to endure to make this child learn. Your own feelings are completely out of the picture. All that matters is whether the child comes to know their arithmetic facts by heart, understand the meaning of the operations deeply enough to know when to apply each one in problem-solving contexts, and quickly and reliably calculate the result of any arithmetic operation with numbers up to two digits long.*

*To accomplish this, every moment you have with the child will be devoted to getting the child to the point where they are able to do all of these things independently.*

*• You will of course introduce each skill along with a quick demonstration, but you won’t ramble about anything that’s irrelevant because your goal will be to have them start attempting to solve problems on each skill as soon as possible.*

*• You will provide corrective feedback on every single problem that they solve, talking them through the correct solution whenever they make a mistake. If they do well, you will quickly move them onwards to more difficult problems, but if they struggle, you will give them however much practice they need to master the skill before moving forwards.*

*• You will cover a mix of different topics every day and continually feed them review problems on previously-learned skills (but not too much review – just a “minimal effective dose” to restore their memory on any topics that they might be in danger of forgetting).*

*• You will also provide frequent timed quizzes on a mixture of different problem types, go over their quizzes with them, give them more practice on anything they missed on the quizzes, and give them a retake to make sure they learned from their mistakes.*

*• Lastly, you will gamify the experience in a way that incentivizes the child to put their best effort forward all the time.*

### Heterogeneity of Student Knowledge Profiles {#heterogeneity-of-student-knowledge-profiles}

#### | Tutoring the King’s Kid vs Teaching Many Kings’ Kids {#|-tutoring-the-king’s-kid-vs-teaching-many-kings’-kids}

The “tutoring the king’s kid” anecdote illustrates that there is no law of physics preventing a teacher from putting forth the work needed to deliver an optimal learning experience to a single student: rather, it is a matter of accountability and incentives.

However, a key assumption in the anecdote is that the teacher is working with a single student. If the same story were told with a class full of 30 children, each from a king who will execute the teacher if their own child fails the test, then it would emphasize a different perspective: the teacher may be doomed because no matter how hard the they try, they will not be able to deliver that same optimal learning experience to every student in the class. Regardless of the level of accountability and incentives, the amount of work required would be inhuman.

Loosely speaking, it boils down to the physics of learning. The reason why it’s so much harder to teach 30 students than to teach a single student is that the 30 students all have unique, heterogeneous knowledge profiles.

#### | Differences in Background Knowledge {#|-differences-in-background-knowledge}

Students who earned different grades in a prerequisite math course typically come into the next course with vastly different knowledge profiles. For instance, students who received a C in the prerequisite course typically have far more foundational knowledge gaps than students who received an A (though even students who received an A usually have *some* foundational knowledge gaps, even if they tend to be fewer and/or less severe). 

Moreover, and more subtly, even students who earned the exact same grade in a prerequisite math course typically have vastly different knowledge profiles from each other. Any two students who mastered the same amount of material in the prerequisite course may *completely differ* in the material that they were unable to master. One student may have struggled with fractions, while another may have struggled with decimals. One student may have struggled with solving equations, while another may have struggled with graphing functions.

![][image59]

#### | Student Knowledge Profiles Naturally Tend Towards Heterogeneity {#|-student-knowledge-profiles-naturally-tend-towards-heterogeneity}

Even in an unrealistic hypothetical scenario where all the students in a class were academic “clones” of one another with exactly the same knowledge profiles, learning speeds, and levels of motivation, their knowledge profiles would naturally diverge over time as the class went on. Despite having the same academic profile, each student would be missing class or spacing out at different times, and as a result, some students would struggle with some topics more than others. (Missing class and spacing out are effectively the same thing, just on different time scales: they differ only in frequency and duration.)

Everyone spaces out sometimes – even adults. It happens constantly, even to people who are consciously trying to pay attention. People have a hard time focusing when they have other things on their minds: what they’re going to eat for lunch, their plans for the weekend, anxiety about a personal relationship, etc. The author of this book spaced out at least twice while writing the four paragraphs in this subsection.

This is especially true for students, who also face an endless list of mini-distractions in a classroom. For instance, a student might need to spend 30 seconds ruffling through their backpack for another pencil/pen or piece of paper (or their friend might ask them for one of those things). Or, a student may need to miss several minutes of class to use the bathroom. 

Regardless of whether it is their fault or not, students are momentarily distracted at different times and they miss things. These differences compound over time unless the teacher immediately detects and fully remediates them at the instant that they arise – but this requires an inhuman amount of work, so teachers aren’t doing it unless they have technology that does it.

#### | Every Student in the Class Effectively Needs a Private Tutor {#|-every-student-in-the-class-effectively-needs-a-private-tutor}

The heterogeneity of student knowledge profiles means that different students need different amounts of practice, on different skills, at different times. Consequently, to deliver an optimal learning experience to all students in the class, the teacher must effectively function as a private tutor for every individual student. Needless to say, no matter how a teacher attempts this, it’s an intractable problem if their class consists of more than a few students. Even if a teacher tries their hardest, they will not be able to deliver an optimal learning experience to every student in the class.

To fully leverage the cognitive learning strategies discussed in this book, and deliver an optimal learning experience to every student in the class, every individual student needs to be fully engaged in productive problem-solving, with immediate feedback (including remedial support when necessary), on the specific types of problems, and in the specific types of settings (e.g., with vs without reference material, blocked vs interleaved, timed vs untimed), that will move the needle the most for their personal learning progress at that specific moment in time. This needs to be happening throughout the entirety of class time, the only exceptions being those brief moments when a student is introduced to a new topic and observes a worked example before jumping into active problem-solving.

However, when students have heterogeneous knowledge profiles, it’s at best extremely difficult, and at worst (and most commonly) impossible, to find a type of problem that is productive for all students in the class. Even if a teacher chooses a type of problem that is appropriate for what they perceive to be the “class average” knowledge profile, it will typically be too hard for many students and too easy for many others (an unproductive use of time for those students either way).

To even know the specific problem types that each student needs to work on, the teacher has to separately track each student’s progress on each problem type, manage a spaced repetition schedule of when each student needs to review each topic, and continually update each schedule based on the student’s performance (which can be incredibly complicated given that each time a student learns or reviews an advanced topic, they’re implicitly reviewing many simpler topics, all of whose repetition schedules need to be adjusted as a result, depending on how the student performed). This is an inhuman amount of bookkeeping and computation.

Furthermore, even on the rare occasion that a teacher manages to find a type of problem that is productive for all students in the class, different students will require different amounts of practice to master the solution technique. Some students will catch on quickly and be ready to move on to more difficult problems after solving just a couple problems of the given type, while other students will require many more attempts before they are able to solve problems of the given type successfully on their own. Additionally, some students will solve problems quickly while others will require more time.

In the absence of technology, it is impossible for a single human teacher to deliver an optimal learning experience to a classroom of many students with heterogeneous knowledge profiles, who all need to work on different types of problems and receive immediate feedback on each attempt. However, technology changes everything. By automatically leveraging cognitive learning strategies to their fullest extent, Math Academy is able to deliver an optimized, adaptive, personalized learning experience to each individual student. Math Academy students are perpetually engaged in productive problem-solving, with immediate feedback (and remediation when necessary), on the specific types of problems (and in the specific types of settings) that will move the needle the most for their personal learning progress.
