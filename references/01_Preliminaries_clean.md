## Chapter 1\. The Two-Sigma Solution {#chapter-1.-the-two-sigma-solution}

***Summary:** Educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom is widely known for demonstrating that one-on-one tutoring produces vastly better learning outcomes than traditional classroom teaching, and documenting how talent development differs from traditional schooling. Math Academy is addressing these issues by creating an adaptive, fully-automated online mathematical talent development platform that emulates the decisions of an expert tutor to provide the most effective way to learn math.*

### Bloom’s Two-Sigma Problem {#bloom’s-two-sigma-problem}

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published a landmark [study](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) comparing the effectiveness of one-on-one tutoring and traditional classroom teaching. The difference was monumental: the average tutored student performed better than 98% of the students in a traditional class.

This finding led to a challenge widely known as **Bloom’s two-sigma problem:** can we develop methods of group instruction that are as effective as one-on-one tutoring? (The terminology “two-sigma” comes from statistics, where the effects of interventions are often measured in standard deviations or *sigmas*. An effect size of 98% is slightly more than two sigmas.)

To [quote](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) Bloom directly (Bloom, 1984):

*“...\[T\]the most striking of the findings is that under the best learning conditions we can devise (tutoring), the average student is 2 sigma above the average control student taught under conventional group methods of instruction.*

*The tutoring process demonstrates that most of the students do have the potential to reach this high level of learning. I believe that an important task of research and instruction is to seek ways of accomplishing this under more practical and realistic conditions than the one-to-one tutoring, which is too costly for most societies to bear on a large scale.*

*This is the ‘2 sigma’ problem. Can researchers and teachers devise teaching-learning conditions that will enable the majority of students under group instruction to attain levels of achievement that at present can be reached only under good tutoring conditions?*  
*…*  
*If the research on the 2 sigma problem yields practical methods … it would be an educational contribution of the greatest magnitude. It would change popular notions about human potential and would have significant effects on what the schools can and should do with the educational years each society requires of its young people.”*

Bloom speculated that an equivalent two-sigma effect might be achieved by combining various evidence-based learning strategies, especially those involving different objects of change (the learner, the instructional material, the home environment or peer group, and the teacher and teaching process) and those that occur at different times in the teaching-learning process.

This is Math Academy’s challenge and purpose. Math Academy is solving Bloom’s two-sigma problem by bringing together many evidence-based cognitive learning strategies into a single online learning platform. Our [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning), fully-automated platform [emulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) the decisions of an expert tutor to provide the most effective way to learn math.

### The Core Essence of Bloom’s Two-Sigma Problem {#the-core-essence-of-bloom’s-two-sigma-problem}

As will be discussed in [Chapter 13](#bookmark=id.pteqpnuccckm), researchers since Bloom have reproduced a high effect size of mastery learning, even if not quite as high as the measure that Bloom observed. But this is beside the point. Bloom’s two-sigma problem is front and center in The Math Academy Way because it frames the core essence of the problem to be solved:

*Properly individualized pedagogy massively elevates student learning outcomes, but society cannot afford to equip every student with a human tutor, so what can we do?*

The core essence of Bloom’s two-sigma problem is not *“the effect size of human tutoring is exactly two sigmas.”* Instead, it's *“there is a ton of student learning that is being left on the table, a ton of human potential that is going unrealized – how do we capture it?”*

Bloom speculated that the benefit of a human tutor could be largely captured by combining various evidence-based learning strategies – but he restricted the search to strategies that could be implemented manually (to some degree, not necessarily to the fullest extent). That was the fatal flaw: the search came up unsuccessful because the search space was constrained by the limits of human teaching labor. This was a reasonable constraint at the time when computer technology was far less mature – but things are completely different today.

Since the early-to-mid 2010s, Math Academy’s challenge and purpose has been to carry the torch forward and re-attempt a solution, this time overcoming the limitation of human teaching labor, leveraging technology to implement individualized learning techniques to a much fuller extent. We started out in a public school district, teaching manually while leveraging individualized learning techniques as much as humanly possible, gradually building up an online system to automate pieces of the work and leverage them to a much fuller extent than we could manually. And we created a teaching machine that is shockingly effective (think: 8th graders passing the AP Calculus BC exam).

### Talent Development vs Traditional Schooling {#talent-development-vs-traditional-schooling}

The core philosophy of Math Academy is centered around **talent development** as opposed to traditional schooling. At surface level, the two ideas may seem similar: after all, isn’t the purpose of schooling to develop students’ talents? Bloom, who researched this question extensively, discovered that the answer is a resounding “no” – the differences between talent development and traditional schooling are so numerous, so striking, and so critical that traditional schooling typically cannot even be characterized as supporting talent development.

Around the same time that Bloom coined the two-sigma problem, he was also immersed in a massive study of talent development. As [summarized](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0261429420934436) by other researchers (Luo & Kiewa, 2020), Bloom (1985) [discovered](https://archive.org/details/developingtalent0000unse) striking commonalities in the upbringing of extremely successful individuals across a wide variety of fields, leading to a general characterization of the process of talent development:

*“Research interest on talent development was sown by psychologist Benjamin Bloom’s (1985) seminal book, Developing Talent in Young People. Bloom studied 120 highly talented individuals across six talent domains and discovered common factors that led to exceptional achievements across domains. In an interview, Bloom remarked:*

*‘We at one time thought that the development of a tennis player would be very different from the development of a concert pianist or a sculptor or a mathematician or a neurologist. What we’ve found is that even though the content and the procedures may be enormously different in each field, there is a common set of characteristics in the home, the instruction, and the like. There is a very general process that seems to be central to the development of talent no matter what the field. (Brandt, 1985: 34)’”*

Bloom [believed](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198509_brandt2.pdf) (Brandt, 1985\) that this talent development process was being leveraged much more effectively in athletic than in academic contexts, and that there was an opportunity to massively elevate students’ degree of learning and academic achievement by reproducing favorable conditions for talent development:

*“I \[Bloom\] firmly believe that if we could reproduce the favorable learning and support conditions that led to the development of these \[extremely successful\] people, we could produce great learning almost everywhere.*  
*…*  
*\[T\]hey \[educators\] do a very good job in sports. There’s nothing we can tell coaches in high schools and colleges. But when we get beyond sports, things are sporadic, accidental. Students may have a good teacher one year and a very poor one the next. And even in the academic subjects, all kinds of chance circumstances are at work. … Schools do not seem to have a great tolerance for students who are out of phase with other students in their learning process.”*

One of the main differences between traditional schooling and talent development, [according](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198111_bloom.pdf) to Bloom & Sosniak (1981), is that students are grouped primarily by age, rather than ability, and each group progresses through the curriculum in lockstep. Each member of the group engages in the same tasks, and it is expected that different students will learn skills to different levels.

*"The school schedule and standards are largely determined by the age of the child. The curriculum and learning experiences are presumably appropriate to most students at that age or grade. While there may be some adjustments for different rates of progress and some adjustment of standards for individuals within a grade or classroom, each individual is instructed as a member of a group with some notion that all are to get as nearly equal treatment as the teacher and the instructional material can supply.*  
*…*  
*\[T\]he group is central in the school learning process and only minimal adjustments are made for individual children. If the group as a whole has difficulty, the teacher will reteach the task or skill until some portion of the group has learned it. But generally, all the children are not expected to learn a task or skill to the same level and little is done with the use of feedback-corrective procedures to bring all children to the same standard of accomplishment.* 

*Since it is not expected that each child will learn to the same standard or level, relative standards are emphasized, but the tasks are the same. Certain children are expected to learn a task to a high level while others are expected to learn it only to a much lower level.”*

In talent development, however, instruction is completely individualized. Learning tasks are chosen based on the specific needs of individual students, each student must learn each skill to a sufficient level of mastery before moving on to more advanced skills. Students progress through skills at different rates, but learn skills to the same threshold of performance. Their progress is measured not by their level of learning in courses that they have taken, but rather by how advanced the skills are that they can execute to a sufficient threshold of performance.

*"Part or all of the instruction the talented individual received was on a one-to-one basis. The pianists had weekly or twice weekly private lessons. … The swimmers worked with many other swimmers in the pool, but the instruction was individualized and personalized. The mathematicians had much less systematic instruction in the early years, but they almost always learned alone or with one adult or peer.*

*Some of the instruction each week was provided by a teacher (tutor) who diagnosed what was needed, set learning objectives, and provided instruction with frequent feedback and correctives. The teacher also suggested appropriate practice, emphasizing specific points or problems to be solved, and set a time by which the individual was expected to attain the objectives to a particular standard. At the end of the set time, the child performed and the teacher noted the gains and what had still to be accomplished, gave corrective instruction, and then gave further instruction for new material and procedures. The teacher praised and encouraged the child for his or her accomplishments, and when the standard was attained, set a new task and further objectives and standards. The cycle of learning tasks, objectives, standards, and motivation was repeated over and over as the child progressed.*

*In talent development, each child was seen as unique and the teacher (tutor) set appropriate learning tasks for the child, gave rewards which the child valued or responded to, and set the pace of learning believed to be appropriate for the individual child. The child's learning rate was central and there was continual adjustment to the child learning the talent. The objectives and standards set by the teacher were always in terms of specific tasks to be accomplished in particular ways by the individual child. While the child was frequently judged in comparison with other children, emphasis was on the accomplishment or mastery of the particular learning tasks set for the individual."*

To recap, Bloom & Sosniak (1981) summarized these differences as follows:

*"In general, school learning emphasizes group learning and the subject or skills to be learned. Talent development typically emphasizes the individual and his or her progress in a particular activity. In school group learning, little is done to help each individual solve his or her special learning problems, while in talent learning the instruction is regarded as good, at least by the parents, only if it helps the individual make clear progress, overcome learning difficulties, and move to higher and higher standards of attainment."*

They also noted that these differences are closely related to the scope of a teacher’s responsibility: in traditional schooling, teachers focus on a “cross section” of many students covering a small subset of curriculum over a short period of time, whereas in talent development, teachers have “longitudinal” accountability for fewer students each learning long progressions of skills over a long periods of time.

*"...\[In talent development, the teacher\] emphasizes the child's progress from lesson to lesson with the child's stage at one time as the benchmark for noting progress or gains. … The teacher is concerned with the child's growth and progress toward what is possible at the highest level. This stems from the likelihood that the teacher will remain with the child over a number of years and also from the teacher's long term view of what is possible for the particular child.*

*In contrast, the schools are arranged by courses. Although the curriculum in a particular subject may extend over a period of ten or more years, each teacher has the child only for a term, year, or course. And the teacher is responsible only for what happens during that period of time. The teacher judges each child in terms of how well he or she is doing in comparison with other children at that grade level or in that class. Each teacher at a particular grade level is primarily concerned with the teaching and learning appropriate to that grade. Little attention is paid to what the child has already learned, or to what each child will need to effectively enter the next grade or course."*

Bloom & Sosniak (1981) also observed that these differences are so critical that traditional schooling typically cannot even be characterized as supporting talent development. As Bloom describes, talent development is not only different from schooling, but in many cases *completely orthogonal* to schooling:

*"For one portion of our sample, talent development and schooling were almost two separate spheres of their life. … Usually the student made the adjustments, resolving the conflict by doing all that was a part of schooling and then finding the additional time, energy, and resources for talent development. … Mathematicians found and worked through special books and engaged in special projects and programs outside of school.*

*Sometimes the schools or particular teachers made minor adjustments to dissipate the conflict. Mathematicians were sometimes excused from a class they were too advanced for and allowed to work on their own in the library. Sometimes they were accelerated one grade as a concession to their outside learning.*  
*...*  
*Whether the individual or the school made these adjustments, it was clear that these adjustments minimized conflict but did little to assist in talent development. The individual was able to work at both schooling and talent development, although with minimum interaction. … Talent development and schooling were isolated from one another. Schooling did not assist in talent development, but in these instances it did not interfere with talent development."*

And while other participants that Bloom studied had more overlap between schooling and talent development, the overlap was not always positive. Rather, it yielded a mixed bag of experiences:

*“For a second portion of our sample, school experiences were a negative influence on their talent development. For these individuals the conflicting requirements of talent development and schooling could rarely be resolved. Schooling was truly something to be suffered through. These individuals found that their efforts in the talent field were not well received by teachers, principals, or peers.*  
*…*  
*For the third portion of our sample, we find the most encouraging role of the schools in talent development. School experiences became a major source of support, encouragement, motivation, and reward for the development of talent. … Some individuals found private support for their development of talent from teachers or principals. These teachers or principals noticed the child’s special development and recognized the quality of his or her work. … They recognized the student’s seriousness and shared with the student an eagerness for working toward very high standards and a commitment to excellence.”*

The general orthogonality of schooling and talent development, and the mixed bag of positive and negative experiences resulting from any overlap between them, echo one of Bloom’s quotes (Brandt, 1985\) at the beginning of this chapter:

*“...\[W\]hen we get beyond sports, things are sporadic, accidental. Students may have a good teacher one year and a very poor one the next. And even in the academic subjects, all kinds of chance circumstances are at work.”*

### Talent Development is Prohibitively Expensive {#talent-development-is-prohibitively-expensive}

Unfortunately, in most fields and particularly in mathematics, there is no widely available solution to the lack of talent development by traditional schools other than 1-on-1 private coaching, which is prohibitively expensive for most families and schools.

To understand just how expensive this is, let’s work through the cost computation. The question that we seek to answer is as follows:

*How much would it cost to develop a student’s mathematical talent to the maximum degree with a 1-on-1 private coach, assuming a reasonable amount of daily work time that is in line with the amount of time that students would be working anyway during the school year?*

In an academic subject like mathematics, 1-on-1 private coaching would be obtained from a tutor. Note, however, that we are *not* concerned with the question “how much does typical usage of supplemental tutoring cost.” We are *not* supposing that the tutor functions as a supplemental assistant who helps a student through their class homework. Instead, we are supposing that the tutor functions as a main instructor, specifically, a private coach who engages the student in 1-on-1 talent development using a personalized training program that is tailored and constantly adapting to their individual needs.

We are supposing that the tutor is hired to completely replace the student’s mathematical training from school, which, as a conservative estimate, is approximately 1 hour per day, 5 days per week. (This estimate is conservative because students typically have 50 minutes of class each day plus 30-60 minutes of homework.) A tutor typically charges at least $50/hour, and $50 × 5 days/week × 52 weeks/year \= $13,000.

This ballpark lower bound is in line with Guryan et al. (2023), who [describe](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20210434) a successful low-cost tutoring intervention (40 minutes per school day, 1 tutor per 2 students) that cost about $4,000 per student per year, with tutors being paid a yearly stipend of only $16,000 (plus benefits) while working through the entire school day (6 class periods). Under these conditions, a full hour of fully individualized tutoring (1 tutor per student) each school day would cost $12,000 per student per year (= $4,000 × 2 × 60/40).

It’s important to note that while these tutors described by Guryan et al. (2023) possessed strong math skills, they were not long-term expert coaches in the sense of the preceding discussion on talent development. Rather, tutors were *“willing to devote one year to public service – for example, recent college graduates, retirees or career-switchers – but do not necessarily have extensive prior training or experience as teachers.”* Needless to say, long-term expert coaches would be far more costly and harder to find.

Additionally, while there do exist mathematical “talent search” competitions in which top competitors are selected for free talent development, only a tiny proportion of highly talented students take the exam and make the cut, and the duration of talent development that they receive is brief. To [quote](https://community.ams.org/journals/notices/201909/rnoti-p1471.pdf) mathematician George Berzsenyi (2019):

*“Participation in each of these \[exams\] is based on performance in the previous competition(s), and hence to a great extent the entire process is aimed at finding about 60 students for the three-week Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program (MOSP), where six students are selected to represent the United States at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).*

*It always bothered me to have several hundred thousand students take the AMC, learn that tens of thousands of them are talented, and then select 60 for a brief talent development program and ignore the rest, expecting them to develop their own capabilities and, if not discouraged, come back the following year to prove themselves again.”*

The goal of Math Academy is to make mathematical talent development widely available to serious students who are motivated to undertake it – and bringing the $13,000 figure down to $499/year (26x cheaper) via Math Academy makes mathematical talent development accessible to many, many more people.

### Stages of Talent Development {#stages-of-talent-development}

#### | Bloom’s 3-Stage Talent Development Process {#|-bloom’s-3-stage-talent-development-process}

As [summarized](https://www.mcgill.ca/sportpsych/files/sportpsych/2002_-_bloom_g.a._2002._role_of_the_elite_coach_in_the_development_of_talent._in_j.m._silva_d.e._stevens_eds._psychological_foundations_of_sport_pp._466-483._boston-_allyn_and_bacon.pdf) by researcher Gordon Bloom (2002), Benjamin Bloom (1985) [observed](https://archive.org/details/developingtalent0000unse) that the journey to developing a talent could be divided into three phases in which the student’s activity in the talent area transitioned from fun and exciting playtime, to intense and strenuous skill refinement, to developing their individual style and pushing the boundaries of the field.

*“Bloom’s (1985) research identified three phases of talent development of expert performers … labeled the early years, the middle developmental years, and the final years of perfecting the skills.*  
*…*  
*\[The early years began\] when individuals were introduced to activities in their sport. … The coach/teacher provided the performer with considerable amounts of positive feedback and approval and allowed the children to play and explore all aspects of the sport. Rewards were garnered for effort rather than for achievement, and rarely was the coach critical of the children.*  
*…*  
*In the second phase or middle years … individuals became fully committed to their performance goals. For the tennis players, the sport became more than a “game,” it became “real business.” … In the early years of development, the coaches had been good at getting the athletes interested in and excited about their sport. In the middle years, however, the athletes and their parents felt they needed someone to teach them precision and technique as well as strategy. They also needed to tailor their skills to emphasize their own personal strengths and to compensate for any weaknesses they might have. … The cultivation of talent now became a top priority for the performer. Coaches demanded more hard work, commitment, and discipline from their athletes. The athletes’ training regimens became more intense and advanced as coaches introduced them to more strenuous and strategic areas of their sport.*  
*…*  
*Later Years. Athletes who achieved high levels of success auditioned for the opportunity to work with … an individual widely recognized as a master teacher or expert in the domain. … \[The athletes\] were totally committed to their chosen activity and would do whatever was necessary to excel. … \[including making\] a number of sacrifices … such as greater expenses and often moving to a new city. … The relationship between athlete and expert coach evolved into one of mutual respect and collegiality with both parties focusing less on instructional methods and more on tactical refinement and the development of the individual’s style. … These coaches challenged their proteges to excel beyond their perceived human capabilities. ‘This was especially true of the Olympic swimmers, who were expected to exceed records beyond that ever previously accomplished by any human being. So, too, was it true of the mathematicians, who were expected to solve problems that had never been solved before’ (Bloom, 1985, p. 525).”*

Math Academy carries students through the second stage of talent development, which centers around intense and strenuous skill development. In this stage, it is assumed that students are motivated, be it intrinsically or extrinsically, to engage in particularly effortful forms of practice that maximize their learning.

Note that Math Academy may not be appropriate for students who remain in Bloom’s first stage and desire a form of educational “playtime,” or students who have progressed to the third stage and are developing original research in mathematics.

#### | Bloom’s Taxonomy is Often Misinterpreted {#|-bloom’s-taxonomy-is-often-misinterpreted}

It’s worth pointing out that while Bloom is widely known for [Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy), this taxonomy is often misinterpreted in a way that is not aligned with Bloom’s 3-Stage Talent Development Process discussed above.

The misinterpretation arises from assuming that the makeup of every year in a student’s education should be balanced the same way across Bloom’s Taxonomy – whereas Bloom’s Talent Development Process suggests that the time allocation should change drastically as a student progresses through their education (i.e., heavily focused on the lower parts of the taxonomy in the middle years, and heavily focused on the higher parts of the taxonomy in the later years). Put simply, Bloom’s Talent Development Process argues for front-loading foundational skill development and then shifting to creative production afterwards.

Why does order matter? Why not just split the time 50-50 between foundational skill development and creative production throughout the whole talent development process? The answer, to be elaborated further in [chapter 8](#bookmark=id.hzqmmfd5p3yu), is this:

* there’s a mountain of empirical evidence that one can increase the number of examples & problem-solving experiences in a student’s knowledge base,

* but a lack of evidence that one can increase the student’s ability to generalize from those examples by engaging in other pedagogical techniques (that is, techniques other than equipping the student with progressively more advanced examples & problem-solving experiences).

In other words, research indicates that the best way to improve a student’s problem-solving ability in any domain is simply by having them acquire more foundational skills in that domain. Below are some entry points into the literature:

[*Teaching General Problem-Solving Skills Is Not a Substitute for, or a Viable Addition to, Teaching Mathematics*](https://ams.org/notices/201010/rtx101001303p.pdf) (Sweller, Clark, & Kirschner, 2010\)

[*Putting Students on the Path to Learning: The Case for Fully Guided Instruction*](https://aft.org/sites/default/files/Clark.pdf) (Clark, Kirschner, & Sweller, 2012\)

[*Should There Be a Three-Strikes Rule Against Pure Discovery Learning?*](https://app.nova.edu/toolbox/instructionalproducts/ITDE_8005/weeklys/2004-Mayer.pdf) (Mayer, 2004\)

[*Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching*](https://tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1) (Mayer, 2004\)

[*Radical Constructivism and Cognitive Psychology*](https://andrew.cmu.edu/user/reder/publications/98_jra_lmr_has.pdf) (Anderson, Reder, & Simon, 1998\)

Armed with this information, if your goal is to maximize your depth within a talent domain, then the optimal rational strategy is a greedy approach:

1. Augment your knowledge base with all the examples and problem-solving experiences in the intended direction, as quickly as possible.

2. Upon reaching the edge of human knowledge in that direction, and only then, switch over to creative production.

Creative production is a substantially less efficient means of acquiring skills within a talent domain, so you want to save it for the end when it’s the only way to continue moving forward.

(To briefly fend off an expected critique: the act of perpetually avoiding the leap into creative production, opting instead to indefinitely “expand sideways,” acquiring skills that are not foundational for the talent domain, does not constitute the above strategy.)

## Chapter 2\. The Science of Learning {#chapter-2.-the-science-of-learning}

***Summary:** Math Academy leverages evidence-based cognitive learning strategies including active learning, deliberate practice, mastery learning, minimizing cognitive load, developing automaticity, layering, non-interference, spaced repetition (distributed practice), interleaving, the testing effect (retrieval practice), and gamification. These methods are backed by decades of research, but they clash with traditional educational practices, which are held in place by convenient misconceptions about learning. By systematically applying these strategies, Math Academy accelerates student learning by 4x, meaning that serious students learn 4x the amount of material in the same time as compared to traditional classrooms.*

### Cognitive Learning Strategies {#cognitive-learning-strategies}

The science of learning has advanced significantly over the past century. Numerous effective cognitive learning strategies have been identified and researched extensively since the early to mid-1900s, with key findings being successfully reproduced over and over again.

At a glance, here are some of the highlights:

* **Active Learning** – students learn more when they are actively performing learning exercises as opposed to passively consuming educational content.

* **Deliberate Practice** – effective learning feels like a workout with a personal trainer and should center around individualized training activities that are chosen to improve specific aspects of one’s performance through repetition and successive refinement.

* **Mastery Learning** – each individual student needs to demonstrate proficiency on prerequisite topics before moving on to more advanced topics.

* **Minimizing Cognitive Load** – because our brains can only process small amounts of new information at once, it’s critical to break down skills and concepts into tiny steps.

* **Developing Automaticity** – to free up mental processing power, it’s also critical to practice low-level skills enough that they can be carried out without requiring conscious effort.

* **Layering** – learning is about making connections. The more connections there are to a piece of knowledge, the more ingrained, organized, and deeply understood it is, and the easier it is to recall. The most efficient way to increase the number of connections to existing knowledge is to continue layering on top of it – that is, continually acquiring new knowledge that exercises prerequisite or component knowledge.

* **Non-Interference** – conceptually related pieces of knowledge should be spaced out over time so that they are less likely to interfere with each other’s recall. New concepts should be taught alongside dissimilar material.

* **Spaced Repetition (Distributed Practice)** – reviews should be spaced out or *distributed* over multiple sessions (as opposed to being crammed or *massed* into a single session) so that memory is not only restored, but also further consolidated into long-term storage, which slows its decay.

* **Interleaving (Mixed Practice)** – the effectiveness of practice is diminished when a single skill is practiced many times consecutively beyond a minimum effective dose. Review problems should be spread out or *interleaved* over multiple review assignments that each cover a broad mix of previously-learned topics. In addition to being more efficient, this also helps students match problems with the appropriate solution techniques.

* **The Testing Effect (Retrieval Practice)** – to maximize the amount by which your memory is extended when solving review problems, it’s necessary to avoid looking back at reference material unless you are totally stuck and cannot remember how to proceed. For this reason, it’s necessary to test frequently as a part of the learning process itself.

* **Gamification** – when game-like elements (such as points and leaderboards) are properly  integrated into student learning environments, students typically not only learn more and engage more with the content, but also enjoy it more. However, these gamified elements must be aligned with the goals of the course, the motivations of the students, and the context of the educational setting. Further, they need to be resistant to “hacking” behaviors that attempt to bypass learning by exploiting loopholes in the rules of the game.

### The Persistence of Tradition {#the-persistence-of-tradition}

One might expect to find these strategies being leveraged in today’s classrooms to drastically improve the depth, pace, and overall success of student learning. However, the disappointing reality is that the practice of education has barely changed, and in many ways remains in *direct opposition* to the strategies outlined above.

* Classes still march through linear sequences of topics according to a predetermined schedule. Students are tethered to the pace of the class, which means that students who get lost are continually asked to learn new topics despite not having mastered the prerequisites, and students who learn quickly are prevented from learning more advanced concepts that come later in the class schedule or in a higher grade level (even if they have already mastered the prerequisites).

* Units of related material are taught in subsequent lessons, which promotes confusion, impedes recall, and places a severe bottleneck on how many topics can be successfully taught simultaneously, thereby creating lots of friction and massively slowing down the learning process.

* After learning a topic during class and practicing it on the homework, students forget about it until it’s time to study for a test – and there are only a handful of tests given throughout the entire duration of a course. After the test, students are rarely required to practice the topic again, unless it just happens that some new topic requires them to remember the old one. The end result is that students end up forgetting most of what they learn.

* All students are given the same homework and assessments. This creates opportunities for coordinated cheating, a wide-open loophole in the grading system. Many students habitually exploit this loophole to bypass learning and obtain grades that do not reflect their (lack of) knowledge.

As [lamented](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-017-0087-y) by Weinstein, Madan, & Sumeracki (2018):

*“The science of learning has made a considerable contribution to our understanding of effective teaching and learning strategies. However, few instructors outside of the field are privy to this research.*

*In particular, a review published 10 years ago identified a limited number of study techniques that have received solid evidence from multiple replications testing their effectiveness in and out of the classroom (Pashler et al., 2007).*

*A recent textbook analysis (Pomerance, Greenberg, & Walsh, 2016\) took the six key learning strategies from this report by Pashler and colleagues, and found that very few teacher-training textbooks cover any of these six principles – and none cover them all, suggesting that these strategies are not systematically making their way into the classroom.*

*This is the case in spite of multiple recent academic (e.g., Dunlosky et al., 2013\) and general audience (e.g., Dunlosky, 2013\) publications about these strategies.”*

Kirschner & Hendrick [sum it up](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003395713/learning-happens-paul-kirschner-carl-hendrick) as follows (2024, pp.275):

*“...\[M\]ost students, and also many or even most teachers, don’t have an accurate picture of the effectiveness of their study approach.*

*After more than a hundred years of research into learning and memory, there are a few things that we know about good and less good approaches. Since the turn of this century, people have been trying to figure out how to remember as much as possible, how to ensure that we forget as little as possible, and how to do this in as little time as possible.*

*The reason we have our doubts with respect to teachers is because the findings that have emerged from this research aren’t yet included in textbooks for teachers (both in research in the US, as well as in the Netherlands and Flanders; Pomerance, Greenberg, & Walsh, 2016; Surma, Vanhoyweghen, Camp, & Kirschner, 2018).”*

As Halpern & Hakel (2003) [emphasize](https://www.mensopschool.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/de-impact-van-lk-op-gemotiveerde-en-ongemotiveerde-lln.pdf) more sharply:

*“Those outside academia further assume that because we are college faculty, we actually have a reasonable understanding of how people learn and that we apply this knowledge in our teaching. … It would be reasonable for anyone reading these fine words to assume that the faculty who prepare students to meet these lofty goals must have had considerable academic preparation to equip them for this task. But this seemingly plausible assumption is, for the most part, just plain wrong.*

*The preparation of virtually every college teacher consists of in-depth study in an academic discipline: chemistry professors study advanced chemistry, historians study historical methods and periods, and so on. Very little, if any, of our formal training addresses topics like adult learning, memory, or transfer of learning.*

*And these observations are just as applicable to the cognitive, organizational, and educational psychologists who teach topics like principles of learning and performing, or evidence-based decision-making.  We have found precious little evidence that content experts in the learning sciences actually apply the principles they teach in their own classrooms. Like virtually all college faculty, they teach the way they were taught.*

*But, ironically (and embarrassingly), it would be difficult to design an educational model that is more at odds with the findings of current research about human cognition than the one being used today at most colleges and universities.*  
*…*  
*There is a large amount of well-intentioned, feel-good psychobabble about teaching out there that falls apart upon investigation of the validity of its supporting evidence.”*

These sentiments are also [echoed](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611861.pdf) by Rohrer & Hartwig (2020):

*“We fear, however, that continued advocacy might fall on deaf ears. … \[E\]mpirical evidence is not highly valued by many of the educators who recommend learning methods and train teachers (e.g., Robinson, Levin, Thomas, Pituch, & Vaughn, 2007; Sylvester Dacy, Nihalani, Cestone, & Robinson, 2011). Against this backdrop, it might be difficult to inspire the kind of support for evidence-based interventions like those that sparked the dramatic improvements in Western medicine over the last century. Doing so, we believe, is the most pressing challenge facing learning scientists.”*

### A Common Theme Preventing Adoption {#a-common-theme-preventing-adoption}

#### | Theme and Examples {#|-theme-and-examples}

So, what happened? Why have these cognitive learning strategies been rejected by the education system? The common theme throughout the literature is that *effective cognitive learning strategies often deviate from traditional conventions, which are held in place by convenient misconceptions about learning.*

The most obvious example of this theme is active learning.

* Traditionally, classes are taught using passive learning: the instructor lectures, and students listen, maybe answering a question here and there. Unsurprisingly, this is not nearly as effective as an active learning class where students spend most of their time actively performing learning exercises.

* However, it has been [shown](https://www.pnas.org/cji/doi/10.1073/pnas.1821936116) (Deslauriers et al., 2019\) that even though students in active learning classes learn more, they *mistakenly perceive* that they learn less. Active learning produces more learning by increasing cognitive activation, but students often *mistakenly* interpret extra cognitive effort (such as productive struggle and occasional confusion) as an indication that they are not learning as well, when in fact the opposite is true.

* Of course, this misconception is a convenient belief for students who want to minimize the amount of effort that they expend during class while still “feeling” as though they are learning (even if it is not really happening). It is also a convenient belief for teachers who enjoy the spotlight and art of lecturing and the “feeling” that their students are learning, do not want to nag students to stay focused during class, and do not suffer repercussions for the reality that is their students’ lack of learning.

Another example of this theme is interleaving (mixed practice).

* Traditionally, homework assignments focus on a single topic (or group of closely related topics) that are practiced many times consecutively beyond a minimum effective dose. This is not nearly as effective as spreading out or *interleaving* those problems over multiple review assignments that each cover a broad mix of previously-learned topics, which is more efficient and also helps students learn to match problems with the appropriate solution techniques.

* However, it has been [shown](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer2009JRME.pdf) (see Rohrer, 2009 for a review) that even though interleaving promotes vastly superior retention and generalization, students again *mistakenly believe* that they are learning less due to the increased cognitive effort. Teachers can be fooled, too, because although interleaving increases performance on cumulative tests, it actually lowers performance on homework (which is otherwise artificially high if students settle into a robotic rhythm of mindlessly applying one type of solution to one type of problem).

* Again, this misconception is a convenient belief for students who want to get through homework as quickly and effortlessly as possible while “feeling” as though they are mastering new skills (even if they are unable to consistently reproduce those skills in true assessment situations). It is also a convenient belief for teachers who want to assign good homework grades and “feel” as though these grades represent their students’ learning, but don’t want to spend extra effort organizing a properly spaced mixed review schedule and fielding a greater number and variety of homework questions from students.

A similar example can be constructed for every cognitive learning strategy that was mentioned earlier in this chapter. In some way or another, each strategy increases the intensity of effort required from students and/or instructors, and the extra effort is then converted into an outsized gain in learning. However, the extra effort also exposes the reality that students didn’t actually learn as much as they (and their teachers) “felt” they did under less effortful conditions. This reality is inconvenient to students and teachers alike; therefore, it is common to simply believe the illusion of learning and avoid activities that might present evidence to the contrary.

More generally, while “innocent until proven guilty” is a good model for a legal system, “competent until proven incompetent” is a poor model for an educational system. If students are not made to demonstrate measurable learning at each step of the way, until they are able to consistently reproduce learned skills in true assessment situations, then the most likely outcome is that very little learning will happen. Whereas the casualties of the legal system are those who are jailed without just cause, the casualties of the education system are those students who are hopelessly pushed to learn advanced skills despite not having actually mastered the prerequisites. Empowering students requires ensuring their learning, and ensuring learning requires interrogating their knowledge.

#### | Desirable Difficulty vs Illusion of Comprehension {#|-desirable-difficulty-vs-illusion-of-comprehension}

This theme is so well-documented in the literature that it even has a catchy name: a practice condition that makes the task harder, slowing down the learning process yet improving recall and transfer, is known as a [**desirable difficulty**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirable_difficulty). As [summarized](http://uweb.cas.usf.edu/~drohrer/pdfs/Rohrer2009JRME.pdf) by Rohrer (2009):

*“A feature that decreases practice performance while increasing test performance has been described by Bjork and his colleagues as a **desirable difficulty**, and spacing and mixing are two of the most robust ones. As these researchers have noted, students and teachers sometimes avoid desirable difficulties such as spacing and mixing because they falsely believe that features yielding inferior practice performance must also yield inferior learning.”*

Many types of cognitive learning strategies introduce desirable difficulties – for instance, Bjork & Bjork (2011) [list](https://burrell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EBjorkRBjork_FABBSchapter2014-2nd-ed._WithCoverPage.pdf) a few more:

*“Such desirable difficulties (Bjork, 1994; 2013\) include varying the conditions of learning, rather than keeping them constant and predictable; interleaving instruction on separate topics, rather than grouping instruction by topic (called blocking); spacing, rather than massing, study sessions on a given topic; and using tests, rather than presentations, as study events.”*

As Bjork & Bjork (2023, pp.21-22) [elaborate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Logan-Fiorella/publication/369588588_Learning_by_Teaching/links/64234a8ca1b72772e431adec/Learning-by-Teaching.pdf#page=27), desirable difficulties make practice more representative of true assessment conditions. Consequently, it is easy for students (and their teachers) to vastly overestimate their knowledge if they do not leverage desirable difficulties during practice, a phenomenon known as the **illusion of comprehension**:

*“A general characteristic of desirable difficulties (such as the spacing or interleaving of study or practice trials) is that they present challenges (i.e., difficulties) for the learner, and hence can even appear to be slowing the rate at which learning is occurring. In contrast, their opposites (such as massing or blocking of study or practice trials) often make performance improve rapidly and can appear to be enhancing learning.*

*Thus, as either learners or teachers, we are vulnerable to being misled as to whether we or our students are actually learning effectively, and, indeed, we can easily be misled into thinking that these latter types of conditions, such as massing or blocking, are actually better for learning. Such dynamics probably play a major role in why students often report that their most preferred and frequently used types of study activity include activities such as rereading chapters (e.g., Bjork et al., 2013), typically right away after an initial reading. Such activities can provide a sense of familiarity or perceptual fluency that we can interpret as reflecting understanding or comprehension and, thus, produce in us what we have sometimes called an **‘illusion of comprehension’** (Bjork, 1999; Jacoby et al., 1994).*

*Similarly, when information comes readily to mind, which frequently is the case in blocked practice, or with no contextual variation in a repeated study or practice setting, we can be led to believe that such immediate access reflects real learning when, in fact, such access is likely to be the product of cues that continue to be present in the unchanging study situation, but that are unlikely to be present at a later time, such as on an exam. As both learners and teachers, we need to be suspicious of conditions of learning, such as massing and blocking, that frequently make performance improve rapidly, but then typically fail to support long-term retention and transfer. To the extent that we interpret current performance as a valid measure of learning, we become susceptible both to mis-judging whether learning has or has not occurred and to preferring poorer conditions of learning over better conditions of learning.”*

#### | The Educational System Prefers Illusion {#|-the-educational-system-prefers-illusion}

As Bjork (1994) [explains](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/spaced-repetition/1994-bjork.pdf), the typical teacher is incentivized to maximize the immediate performance and/or happiness of their students, which biases them against introducing desirable difficulties and incentivizes them to promote illusions of comprehension:

*“Recent surveys of the relevant research literatures (see, e.g., Christina & Bjork, 1991; Farr, 1987; Reder & Klatzky, 1993; Schmidt & Bjork, 1992\) leave no doubt that many of the most effective manipulations of training – in terms of post-training retention and transfer – share the property that they introduce difficulties for the learner.*  
*…*  
*If the research picture is so clear, why then are … nonproductive manipulations such common features of real-world training programs? … \[T\]he typical trainer is overexposed, so to speak, to the day-to-day performance and evaluative reactions of his or her trainees. A trainer, in effect, is vulnerable to a type of operant conditioning, where the reinforcing events are improvements in the \[immediate\] performance and/or happiness of trainees.*

*Such a conditioning process, over time, can act to shift the trainer toward manipulations that increase the rate of correct responding – that make the trainee’s life easier, so to speak. Doing that, of course, will move the trainer away from introducing the types of **desirable difficulties** summarized in the preceding section.”*

What’s more, most educational organizations operate in a way that exacerbates this issue:

*“The tendency for instructors to be pushed toward training programs that maximize the performance or evaluative reaction of their trainees during is exacerbated by certain institutional characteristics that are common in real-world organizations.*

*First, those responsible for training are often themselves evaluated in terms of the performance and satisfaction of their trainees during training, or at the end of training.*

*Second, individuals with the day-to-day responsibility for training often do not get a chance to observe the post-training performance of the people they have trained; a trainee’s later successes and failures tend to occur in settings that are far removed from the original training environment, and from the trainer himself or herself.*

*It is also rarely the case that systematic measurements of post-training on-the-job performance are even collected, let alone provided to a trainer as a guide to what manipulations do and do not achieve the post-training goals of training.*

*And, finally, where refresher or retraining programs exist, they are typically the concern of individuals other than those responsible for the original training.”*

As a result, these cognitive learning strategies often ruffle the feathers of educational traditionalists, whose immediate response is to lash out against it. Take it [directly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279650/pdf/jaba00015-0061.pdf) from John Gilmour Sherman (1992), a professor who implemented evidence-based learning strategies in his own classroom, only to be shut down for no reason other than his superior’s unsupported opinions about how learning works:

*“Avoiding a frontal attack, the chairman of the Psychology Department at Georgetown declared by fiat that something on the order of 50% of class time must be devoted to lecturing. By reducing the possibility of self-pacing to zero, this effectively eliminated PSI \[Personalized System of Instruction\] courses.*

*He issued this order on the grounds that in the context of lecturing ‘it is the dash of intellects in the classroom that informs the student.’ No data were presented on this point\! The spectacle of purporting to defend scholarship while deciding the merits of instructional methods by assertion is silly.*

*The troubling aspect of all these cases was that data played no part in the decisions. It is disturbing when one has to wonder whether research on the education process makes any difference.”*

Ultimately, Sherman’s experiences led him to conclude that

*“...\[T\]he investment in keeping things as they are may be impossible to overcome. … Improving instruction is the goal, but only in the context of not changing anything that is important to any vested interest. … \[When the role of the teacher\] does not conform to what most people think of as teaching; this is a problem and an obstacle to implementation.”*

This sentiment continues into recent years. As Bjork & Bjork (2023, pp.19) [reminisce](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Logan-Fiorella/publication/369588588_Learning_by_Teaching/links/64234a8ca1b72772e431adec/Learning-by-Teaching.pdf#page=26):

*“Having been asked to convey in ‘our own words’ what we most want students and teachers to know regarding how to apply findings from the science of learning has led us to think back on our efforts to spread the desirable difficulties gospel, so to speak. It verges on laughable that we thought 25 years or so ago that we would simply tell people about certain key findings, and they would then immediately change how they managed their own learning.”*

Or, as Rohrer & Hartwig (2020) [put it](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED611861.pdf) bluntly:

*“...\[T\]he success of an intervention depends partly on whether students and teachers are willing to use it. Too often, the classroom is where promising interventions go to die.”*

### Technology Changes Everything {#technology-changes-everything}

#### | Revival via Technology {#|-revival-via-technology}

It is unfortunate that Sherman and countless other researchers, practitioners, and proponents of [evidence-based education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_education) are no longer alive to see their life’s work positively transform the practice of education – and especially so for those like Sherman (1992) who eventually despaired “whether research on the education process makes any difference.”

However, some did maintain hope that one day their contributions might be revived in the future when computers advanced far enough to make individualized digital learning environments technologically possible and commercially viable. 

Indeed, these cognitive learning strategies are now some of the main guiding principles behind Math Academy. By leveraging these strategies to their fullest effect and capitalizing on their compounding nature, Math Academy is proud to offer a learning environment where students can learn many times more than they would otherwise in a traditional classroom.

#### | Necessity of Technology {#|-necessity-of-technology}

In building this environment, we discovered something interesting: technology not only lets us circumvent the opposing inertia in the education system, but also helps us leverage these cognitive learning strategies to a degree that would not be feasible for even the most agreeable and hard-working human teacher. While it’s true that a human teacher can reap some benefits of these strategies while maintaining a reasonable workload (and there really is no good excuse for not doing so), technology enables us to leverage these strategies to their full extent and produce even better learning outcomes than a human teacher who uses loose approximations of these strategies as much as humanly possible.

For instance, consider spaced repetition. While some curricula now adopt a [spiral approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_approach) where material is naturally revisited and further built upon in later textbook chapters and/or grades, this is nowhere near the level of granularity, precision, and individualization that is required to capture the maximum benefit of true spaced repetition. Taken to its fullest extent, spaced repetition requires the instructor to keep track of a repetition schedule for every student for every topic and continually update that schedule based on the student’s performance – and each time a student learns (or reviews) an advanced topic, they’re implicitly reviewing many simpler topics, all of whose repetition schedules need to be adjusted as a result.

Of course, this is an inhuman amount of work. In fact, before building our online system, we actually tried performing a loose approximation of spaced repetition manually while teaching in a human-to-human classroom. It turned out that, teaching just two classes with only a handful of students in each class, it took more time and effort than a full-time job to implement a very loose approximation of spaced repetition *for the class as a whole* – not even personalized to individual students. And that’s just one of many strategies that are necessary for effective teaching\!

But just because fully leveraging these cognitive learning strategies requires an inhuman amount of work, doesn’t mean that there’s little to gain from it (especially when a century of research has shown that these strategies lead to immense improvements in learning). All it means is that the human teacher is a bottleneck to effective teaching. And what’s always the solution when manual human effort is a bottleneck? Technology.

#### | Accelerating Student Learning by 4x {#|-accelerating-student-learning-by-4x}

By building a system that fully leverages these cognitive strategies, we have accelerated student learning by 4x: on Math Academy, serious students learn 4x the amount of material in the same time (or the same amount of material in a quarter of the time) as compared to traditional classrooms. And that’s being conservative, since our courses tend to be even more comprehensive than what you’d find in a traditional classroom. (Our courses aim to cover the superset of all content that one could reasonably expect to find in any major textbook or standard class syllabus.)

The 4x factor is a hard measurement, backed by concrete numbers:

* We measure our course length in terms of XP. One XP is approximately one minute of focused effort, give or take, depending on the individual student. We model our average student on a serious (but imperfect) student who works an average of 40 XP per weekday.

* Using the AP Calculus BC Course as a comparison, a typical student in a school will have a 50-minute class five days per week plus about an hour of homework per night. Throughout a typical 32-week school year, that’s a total of (50 minutes class \+ 60 minutes homework average per day) (five days) (32 weeks) \= 17,600 minutes.  Add in a couple extra hours for each test and quiz throughout each semester and then at least 30-40 hours for practice exams and studying for the AP exam, if you want to get a 5\. That will put you in the ballpark of our calculation of 24,000 minutes.

* The Math Academy AP Calculus BC Course is approximately 6,000 XP (equivalent to about 6,000 minutes) and already includes quizzes, reviews, and highly specific test prep.

The rest of the book describes how our technology accomplishes this.

## Chapter 3\. Core Science: How the Brain Works {#chapter-3.-core-science:-how-the-brain-works}

***Summary:** Cognition involves the flow of information through sensory, working, and long-term memory banks in the brain. Sensory memory temporarily holds raw data, working memory manipulates and organizes information, and long-term memory stores it indefinitely by creating strategic electrical wiring between neurons. Learning amounts to increasing the quantity, depth, retrievability, and generalizability of concepts and skills in a student’s long-term memory. Limited working memory capacity creates a bottleneck in the transfer of information into long-term memory, but cognitive learning strategies can be used to mitigate the effects of this bottleneck.*

### Sensory, Working, and Long-Term Memory {#sensory,-working,-and-long-term-memory}

In order to develop a good intuitive sense of how learning can be optimized, it’s crucial to understand – at a concrete, physical level in the brain – what learning actually *is*. At the most fundamental level, **learning** is the creation of strategic electrical wiring between **neurons** (“brain cells”) that improves the brain’s ability to perform a task.

When the brain thinks about objects, concepts, associations, etc, it represents these things by activating different patterns of neurons with electrical impulses. Whenever a neuron is activated with electrical impulses, the impulses naturally travel through its outward connections to reach other neurons, potentially causing those other neurons to activate as well. By creating strategic connections between neurons, the brain can more easily, quickly, accurately, and reliably activate more intricate patterns of neurons.

As one might expect, it is extraordinarily complicated to understand what these specific brain patterns are, how they interact, and how the brain identifies strategic ways to improve its connectivity. However, to some extent, these are just nature’s way of implementing cognition – and the overarching cognitive processes of the brain are much better understood.

At a high level, human cognition is characterized by the flow of information across three memory banks:

1. [**Sensory memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_memory) temporarily holds a large amount of raw data observed through the senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch), only for several seconds at most, while relevant data is transferred to short-term memory for more sophisticated processing.

2. [**Short-term memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_memory), and more generally, [**working memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), has a much lower capacity than sensory memory, but it can store the information about ten times longer. Working memory consists of short-term memory along with capabilities for organizing, manipulating, and generally “working” with the information stored in short-term memory. The brain’s working memory capacity represents the degree to which it can focus activation on relevant neural patterns and persistently maintain their simultaneous activation, a process known as [rehearsal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_rehearsal).

3. [**Long-term memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory) effortlessly holds indefinitely many facts, experiences, concepts, and procedures, for indefinitely long, in the form of strategic electrical wiring between neurons. Wiring induces a “domino effect” by which entire patterns of neurons are automatically activated as a result of initially activating a much smaller number of neurons in the pattern. The process of storing new information in long-term memory is known as [consolidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_consolidation). At a cognitive level, **learning** can be described as a positive change in long-term memory.

These memory banks work together to form the following pipeline for processing information:

1. **Sensory memory** receives a stimulus from the environment and passes on important details to working memory.

2. **Working memory** holds and manipulates those details, often augmenting or substituting them with related information that was previously stored in long-term memory.

3. **Long-term memory** curates important information as though it were writing a “reference book” for the working memory.  
   

Note, however, that there is a crucial conceptual difference between long-term memory and a reference textbook: long-term memory can be forgotten. The text in a reference book remains there forever, accessible as always, regardless of whether you read it – but the representations in long-term memory gradually, over time, become harder to retrieve if they are not used, resulting in forgetting. The phenomenon of forgetting in long-term memory has been [widely researched](https://www.mcgill.ca/science/files/science/channels/attach/hardt_et_al_-_decay_happens_-_the_role_of_active_forgetting_in_memory.pdf) and can be characterized as follows (Hardt, Nader, & Nadel, 2013):

*“...\[F\]orgetting refers to the absence of expression of previously properly acquired memory in a situation that normally would cause such expression. This can reflect actual memory loss or a failure to retrieve existing memory.”*

However, the lower-level mechanisms underlying forgetting in long-term memory are not yet well understood.

![][image2]

There are two complementary perspectives by which we can think about this pipeline.

* [**encoding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_\(memory\)) perspective – the pipeline converts or “encodes” information from the outside world into a representation that can be stored in long-term memory and later recalled.

* [**executive function**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) (or **cognitive control**) perspective – the pipeline is centered around working memory, which pulls relevant information from sensory and long-term memory into an area where it can be combined, transformed, and used to guide behavior to achieve goals. 

In the context of mathematical talent development, once a student is beyond the stage of learning how to read and count, we are less concerned with their sensory memory and more concerned with their long-term memory. The goal of instruction is to increase the quantity, depth, retrievability, and generalizability of mathematical concepts and skills in the student’s long-term memory.

The student’s working memory capacity is a bottleneck in the transfer of information into their long-term memory. However, by leveraging cognitive learning strategies and properly scaffolding and adapting instruction to the student’s individual needs, we can minimize the degree to which their working memory capacity limits their learning, thereby maximizing the transfer of new information and the retention of existing information in long-term memory.

### Design Constraints {#design-constraints}

The brain’s information-processing pipeline is designed to be incredibly efficient. However, even the most efficient designs have limitations. Design is all about balancing trade-offs to achieve the best possible outcome in the face of constraints. To understand the constraints and the rationale behind a design, it can be helpful to attempt some naive critiques.

***Critique:** Why is long-term memory needed? Why can’t the brain just hold everything in working memory forever through rehearsal?*

**Rationale:** Rehearsal requires a lot of effort. It is very taxing on the brain. When the brain engages in rehearsal, it’s like a muscle that is lifting a weight.

Just like a muscle has a limit to the amount of weight it can hold, the brain has a [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two) to the amount of new information it can hold in working memory via rehearsal. Most people can only hold about [7 digits](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2364276_4/component/file_2364275/content) (or more generally [4 chunks](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/magical-number-4-in-shortterm-memory-a-reconsideration-of-mental-storage-capacity/44023F1147D4A1D44BDC0AD226838496) of [coherently grouped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_\(psychology\)) items) simultaneously and only for about [20 seconds](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470215808416249?journalCode=qjpa) (Miller, 1956; Cowan, 2001; Brown, 1958). And that assumes they aren’t needing to perform any mental manipulation of those items – if they do, then [fewer items](https://academic.oup.com/geronj/article-abstract/36/5/605/550194) can be held due to competition for limited processing resources (Wright, 1981).

Long-term memory solves this problem by providing a place where the brain can store lots of information for a long time without requiring much effort.

***Critique:** Why doesn’t the brain just store everything it encounters in long-term memory? That way, it would never forget anything.* 

**Rationale:** When it comes to information storage, more is not always better. In order for it to be worthwhile to store a piece of information, the benefit must offset the cost. Creating connections between neurons is costly in the sense that it requires biological resources – the connections are physical growths between cells, which means they have to be actively constructed and maintained by the body.

To illustrate with a concrete example, suppose that you want to buy a biography book that will help you understand somebody’s background and their impact on society. One book contains 300 pages, costs $20, and covers formative experiences in their childhood, their career arc, and occasional anecdotes to illustrate key points and themes. Another book contains 10,000 pages, costs $1,000, covers all of the information in the first book, and also includes a description of every single meal the person ate throughout their life. Unless you have a specific, intense interest in this person’s dietary habits (which you probably don’t), it’s easy to see that the first option is superior.

### Case Study: Information Flow During a Computation {#case-study:-information-flow-during-a-computation}

To illustrate how information flows through these memory banks when solving a math problem, let’s analyze what happens as we compute 43 using typical arithmetic strategies while writing down some intermediate steps. (Remember that exponentiation is just repeated multiplication: 43 means to take three 4’s and multiply them together, that is, 43 \= 4 × 4 × 4 \= 64.)

First, let’s get a sense of how each memory bank will help us solve the problem:

1. **Sensory memory** will capture visual data that lets us read the problem or any intermediate work that we’ve written down, thereby allowing the written information to be loaded into working memory. It will also filter out any distractions (e.g. background noise) as we solve the problem.

2. **Working memory** will hold the relevant pieces of the problem, request additional information from long-term memory, and apply that information to incrementally transform the pieces of the problem into the solution. Our problem-solving narrative will take place within the working memory.

3. **Long-term memory** will, upon request from working memory, produce definitions, facts, and procedures that we learned previously. It is like an internal “reference book” that we can use to look up additional information that would be helpful while solving the current problem.

It’s worth re-emphasizing that the problem-solving narrative will take place within the working memory. Sensory and long-term memory will supply working memory with information, which working memory will combine, transform, and use to guide our behavior to solve the problem. As researchers [elaborate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2080868/) (Roth & Courtney, 2007):

*“Working memory (WM) is the active maintenance of currently relevant information so that it is available for use. A crucial component of WM is the ability to update the contents when new information becomes more relevant than previously maintained information. New information can come from different sources, including from sensory stimuli (SS) or from long-term memory (LTM).*  
*…*  
*In order for information in working memory to guide behavior optimally … it must reflect the most relevant information according to the current context and goals. Since the context and the goals change frequently it is necessary to update the contents of WM selectively with the most relevant information while protecting the current contents of WM from interference by irrelevant information.*  
*…*  
*There are … many ways in which WM can be changed, including through the manipulation of information being maintained (Cohen et al., 1997; D'Esposito, Postle, Ballard and Lease, 1999), the addition or removal of items being maintained (Andres, Van der Linden and Parmentier, 2004), or the replacement of one item with another (Roth, Serences, and Courtney, 2006).”*

Now, let’s walk through the specific steps needed to solve the problem while observing what happens in each memory bank.

| Sensory Memory (SM) | Working Memory(WM) | Long-Term Memory (LTM) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| View problem: 43  Send relevant info to WM: 4 exponent 3 View written work: 16 × 4 40 Send relevant info to WM: 16 × 4, “one number written down” View written work: 16 × 4 40 \+ 24 Send relevant info to WM: 40 \+ 24 View written work: 16 × 4 40 \+ 24 6 Send relevant info to WM: 40 \+ 24, “one number written down” View written work: 16 × 4 40 \+ 24 64 Send relevant info to WM: 64 |  Rehearsing: 4 exponent 3 Request definition of exponent from LTM. Rehearsing: 4 exponent 3, “A exponent B means A multiplied by itself B times” Apply  “A exponent B means A multiplied by itself B times” to 4 exponent 3 to get 4 × 4 × 4\. Clear out all other WM. Rehearsing: 4 × 4 × 4 Request procedure of repeated multiplication from LTM. Rehearsing: 4 × 4 × 4, “multiply in any order, but left-to-right by default” Apply  “multiply in any order, but left-to-right by default” to 4 × 4 × 4 to get (4 × 4\) × 4\. Clear out all other WM. Rehearsing: (4 × 4\) × 4 Request 4 × 4 from LTM. Rehearsing: (4 × 4\) × 4, 4 × 4 \= 16 Apply 4 × 4 \= 16 to (4 × 4\) × 4, resulting in 16 × 4\. Clear out all other WM. Rehearsing: 16 × 4 Request 16 × 4 from LTM. Rehearsing: 16 × 4, “multiply place values separately and add results” (Write 16 × 4 on paper for later reloading.) Apply “multiply place values separately and add results” to 16 × 4\. Tens place value is 10 so multiply 10 × 4\. Clear out 16 × 4 from WM. Rehearsing: 10 × 4, “multiply place values separately and add results” Request 10 × 4 from LTM. Rehearsing: 10 × 4 \= 40, “multiply place values separately and add results” (Write 40 on paper for later reloading) Reload WM. Rehearsing: 16 × 4, “multiply place values separately and add results”, “one number written down” Apply “multiply place values separately and add results” and “one number written down” to 16 × 4\. Next is ones place; ones place value is 6 so multiply 6 × 4\. Clear out all other WM. Rehearsing: 6 × 4 Request 6 × 4 from LTM. Rehearsing: 6 × 4 \= 24 (Write 24 on paper for later reloading) Reload WM. Rehearsing: 40 \+ 24 Request 40 \+ 24 from LTM. Rehearsing: 40 \+ 24, “add digits” Apply “add digits” to 40 \+ 24\. First digit will be 4 \+ 2\. Clear all other WM. Rehearsing: 4 \+ 2, “add digits” Request 4 \+ 2 from LTM. Rehearsing: 4 \+ 2 \= 6, “add digits” (Write 6 on paper for later reloading) Reload WM. Rehearsing: 40 \+ 24, “add digits”, “one number written down” Apply “add digits” and “one number written down” to 40 \+ 24\. Second digit will be 0 \+ 4\. Clear out all other WM. Rehearsing: 0 \+ 4 Request 0 \+ 4 from LTM. Rehearsing: 0 \+ 4 \= 4 (Write 4 on paper for later reloading) Reload WM. Rehearsing: 64 Answer is 64\.  |  Retrieve definition: “A exponent B means A multiplied by itself B times” Retrieve procedure: “multiply in any order, but left-to-right by default” Retrieve fact: 4 × 4 \= 16 Unable to retrieve fact 16 × 4\. Automatic redirect to retrieve procedure: “multiply place values separately and add results” Retrieve fact: 10 × 4 \= 40 Retrieve fact: 6 × 4 \= 24 Unable to retrieve 40 \+ 24\. Automatic redirect to procedure: “add digits” Retrieve fact: 4 \+ 2 \= 6 Retrieve fact: 0 \+ 4 \= 4 |

What learning resulted from this computation? Remember that learning occurs when the wiring of long-term memory is changed in a positive way that increases a student’s ability to perform a task. This can involve any combination of wiring up new information, wiring up connections between existing pieces of information, reorganizing existing wiring so that the information can be retrieved more efficiently, etc.

With this in mind, let’s take inventory of the processes that occurred within long-term memory in the example above:

* *Retrieval of definitions:*  
       “A exponent B means A multiplied by itself B times”

* *Retrieval of facts:*  
       4 × 4 \= 16  
       10 × 4 \= 40  
       6 × 4 \= 24  
       4 \+ 2 \= 6  
       0 \+ 4 \= 4

* *Redirects to procedures (and retrieval/execution of those procedures):*  
       4 × 4 × 4  →  “multiply in any order, but left-to-right by default”  
       16 × 4  →  “multiply place values separately and add results”  
       40 \+ 24  →  “add digits”

All of these pieces of information will become further consolidated in long-term memory, and there will be additional wiring connecting these component skills as part of a larger procedure for computing exponents.

Additionally, the fact 43 \= 64 will also begin consolidating in long-term memory (though it will soon be forgotten unless it is repeatedly reviewed into the future). Indeed, many people who frequently perform mental math with exponents know their cubes from 13 to 63 by heart and can simply retrieve their values as opposed to computing them.

### Neuroscience of Working Memory {#neuroscience-of-working-memory}

Recall that when the brain thinks about objects, concepts, associations, etc, it represents these things by activating different patterns of neurons with electrical impulses. Loosely speaking, the brain’s working memory capacity represents the degree to which it can focus activation on relevant neural patterns and persistently maintain their simultaneous activation. The cognitive load of a task represents the level of exertion that the brain would experience while completing the task.

(More strictly speaking: higher working memory capacity refers not to the ability to sustain *more* neural activity in the energy sense, but rather, the ability to sustain *relevant* neural activity while suppressing interference from irrelevant neural activity. At a biological level, hitting a working memory capacity limit does not entail exhausting one’s ability to maintain *more* neural activity, but rather exhausting one’s ability to maintain focus and attention, that is, appropriate *concentration* or *allocation* of one’s neural activity.)

As [summarized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2429995/) by D'Esposito (2007):

*“...\[T\]he neuroscientific data presented in this paper are consistent with most or all neural populations being able to retain information that can be accessed and kept active over several seconds, via persistent neural activity in the service of goal-directed behaviour.*

*The observed persistent neural activity during delay tasks may reflect active rehearsal mechanisms. Active rehearsal is hypothesized to consist of the repetitive selection of relevant representations or recurrent direction of attention to those items.*  
*…*  
*Research thus far suggests that working memory can be viewed as neither a unitary nor a dedicated system. A network of brain regions, including the PFC \[prefrontal cortex\], is critical for the active maintenance of internal representations that are necessary for goal-directed behaviour. Thus, working memory is not localized to a single brain region but probably is an emergent property of the functional interactions between the PFC and the rest of the brain.”*

Long-term learning is represented by the creation of strategic electrical wiring between neurons. Whenever a neuron is activated with electrical impulses, the impulses naturally travel through its outward connections to reach other neurons, potentially causing those other neurons to activate as well. By creating strategic connections between neurons, the brain can more easily, quickly, accurately, and reliably activate more intricate patterns of neurons.

Talcott (2021) [summarizes](https://solportal.ibe-unesco.org/articles/the-neurodevelopmental-underpinnings-of-childrens-learning-connectivity-is-key) this process as follows:

*“Individual neurons can be thought of as rather simple biological batteries, each maintaining a gradient of biochemical ions across its cell membrane, which results in a small, local electrical charge – or potential.*  
*…*  
*Incoming signals from neighbouring brain cells are communicated to the neuron’s dendrites and act to continuously modify the magnitude of the neuron’s electrical charge. When the sum of signals from other neurons drives the electrical gradient to and then past a critical voltage, an electrical signal – the action potential – is generated and propagated along the neuron’s axon. This signal ultimately modulates the activity of other neurons to which it connects.*

*This process of synaptic transmission comprises the release of neurotransmitter chemicals at the junction between two cells – the synapse. Neurotransmitters released in response to the action potential in the pre-synaptic cell bind to receptors on the dendrites of the post-synaptic cell. The effects of such neurotransmitter binding serve to modify the electrical potential in the cell, either exciting it toward generating an action potential or inhibiting it from doing so.*  
*…*  
*Cognition – our thinking, reasoning and learning processes – are derived from activity in neural networks within the brain … Neurodevelopment is a lifelong process involving the modification of the structural and functional properties of the brain … One of the most striking aspects of the post-natal neurodevelopmental period in early childhood is in this near continuous refinement of neural connectivity, including both the strengthening of productive synapses and elimination of those that are less robust or redundant…*

*Structural and functional connectivity provides mechanisms for implementing adaptation of the brain in response to an individual’s experience of the world. As children are born with nearly a full complement of brain cells, adaptation of responses to environmental change – the underlying basis of learning for any organism – is accomplished mainly through modifying neural connectivity. Connectivity increases in parallel with children’s advancement of their cognitive capacities and learning achievement.*

*Adapted from a theory first articulated by Donald Hebb in the 1940, one well-supported principle regarding the relationships between brain structure and function in the developing brain is ‘what fires together, wires together’ … When reinforced through repetition (experience), this coupling increases the probability of their activity being coincident in the future. This feedback process also works in reverse, such that connections that are not actively reinforced can be eliminated through a competitive elimination process, which favours the survival of more functionally adaptive networks at the expense of less efficient or redundant competitor networks through development...*

*These mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are widely considered to be a predominant way through which information is coded and retained in brain networks … Learning and memory (a cognitive demonstration of learning through recall of material to which an individual has been exposed) are therefore both expressed in the brain and related at the neural level to modification of connectivity within neural networks in response to repeated patterns of environmental stimuli and their associations.”*

Wiring induces a “domino effect” by which entire patterns of neurons are automatically activated as a result of initially activating a much smaller number of neurons in the pattern. However, when the brain is initially learning something, the corresponding neural pattern has not been “wired up” yet, which means that the brain has to devote effort to activating each neuron in the pattern. In other words, because the dominos have not been set up yet, each one has to be toppled in a separate stroke of effort. This imposes severe limitations on how much new information the brain can hold simultaneously in working memory.

## Chapter 4\. Core Technology: the Knowledge Graph {#chapter-4.-core-technology:-the-knowledge-graph}

***Summary:** Math Academy utilizes a knowledge graph, an interconnected structure of thousands of topics from 4th grade through university-level mathematics, to organize its curriculum and facilitate algorithmic decision-making. The knowledge graph allows Math Academy to place each student at the edge of their individual “knowledge frontier,” fill in any gaps in foundational knowledge, leverage mastery learning to efficiently extend student knowledge, provide spaced reviews and remedial reviews when necessary, and capitalize on “encompassing” relationships to achieve turbo-boosted learning speed.*

### Understanding the Knowledge Graph {#understanding-the-knowledge-graph}

#### | Linking Topics and Prerequisites {#|-linking-topics-and-prerequisites}

To understand how Math Academy leverages specific cognitive learning strategies, it is helpful to have high-level understanding of our [**knowledge graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), which organizes our curriculum in a way that enables algorithmic decision-making.

Here, the word *“graph”* is a term that readers may be unfamiliar with. Usually, the word *“graph”* refers to a chart illustrating the relationship between two variables, such as a bar chart or a line chart. But in our context, the word *“graph”* refers to a diagram consisting of objects and arrows between them. This terminology is common in the mathematical field of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

Our knowledge graph contains multiple thousands of interlinked **topics**. Each linkage between topics indicates a relationship between them, such as one topic being a **prerequisite** for another topic. (There are lots of different kinds of relationships, but for now, we’ll just focus on prerequisites.)

For instance, below is a simple example of a knowledge graph that shows a topic *Adding Fractions and Whole Numbers Using Models* (bottom) that is the prerequisite for three other topics (top). After a student learns the topic on the bottom, they will be ready to learn any topic that it points to. In other words, the arrows point along potential “learning paths” that the student can follow.

![][image3]

However, if multiple arrows point to a higher topic, then that means the higher topic has multiple prerequisites that the student needs to learn beforehand.

To illustrate, the topic *Adding Fractions With Unlike Denominators* has been added to the top of the knowledge graph. As indicated by the arrows pointing to it, it has two prerequisites that the student needs to learn beforehand:

1. *Adding Fractions With Unlike Denominators Using Models*  
2. *Adding Fractions and Whole Numbers*

![][image4]

#### | Zooming Out {#|-zooming-out}

Zooming out more, we see that knowledge graphs can encode a lot of complicated information that would otherwise be hard to describe and reason about.

![][image5]

Zooming out *even more*, below is the knowledge graph for an entire course consisting of about 300 topics.

![][image6]

Fully zoomed out, Math Academy’s entire curriculum consists of *multiple thousands* of topics spanning 4th Grade through university-level math. All these topics are connected up together in the knowledge graph. In this view, a course is simply a section of our knowledge graph. (In the visualization below, different colors represent different courses.)

![][image7]

The knowledge graph above contains the following courses: *4th Grade Math, 5th Grade Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, \*Differential Equations, \*Probability & Statistics, \*Discrete Mathematics, \*Abstract Algebra.* (As of October 2023, this accounts for most, but not all, of the content in our system – courses not listed have large overlap with the preceding list. Asterisks indicate that a course is still under development.)

#### | Course Graph {#|-course-graph}

On school and university websites, it is common to see courses arranged into a **course graph**, which can be interpreted as a highly-compressed version of a knowledge graph where a single entity represents hundreds of topics. Math Academy’s course graph (as of October 2023\) is shown below:

![][image8]

However, it is important to realize that each course is ultimately just a set of topics in the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph is the ultimate source of truth; a course graph simply summarizes and communicates information about the high-level structure of a knowledge graph so that humans can understand it.

### Using the Knowledge Graph {#using-the-knowledge-graph}

#### | Scaffolded Mastery Learning {#|-scaffolded-mastery-learning}

Math Academy’s knowledge graph enables us to implement **mastery learning**, in which students demonstrate proficiency on **prerequisites** before moving on to more advanced topics.

![][image9]

Each topic involves a **lesson** that is broken down into several key pieces of learning called **knowledge points**. Each knowledge point contains a **worked example** and asks **questions** similar to the worked example.

Knowledge points build on each other to help **scaffold** students through the lesson: the first knowledge point covers the most basic idea or skill of the lesson, and later knowledge points gently introduce more advanced cases.

![][image10]

To demonstrate mastery of a topic, a student must answer sufficiently many questions correctly in each successive knowledge point in the lesson. Once this is accomplished, more advanced topics become available for the student to work on.

| ![][image11] | →  | ![][image12] |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

#### | Additional Linkages {#|-additional-linkages}

##### \> Key Prerequisites Enable Targeted Remediation {#>-key-prerequisites-enable-targeted-remediation}

Each knowledge point is linked to one or more **key prerequisite** topics that represent the prerequisite knowledge that is most directly being used in that knowledge point. If a student ever fails a lesson twice at the same knowledge point, we automatically provide remedial reviews on the key prerequisites. This helps the student strengthen their foundations in the areas where they are most in need of additional practice, so that they are better prepared to pass the lesson the next time around.

As a concrete example, suppose that while re-attempting the lesson *Exponents with Rational Bases*, a student

* manages to pass *Part 1: Expressing a Product Using an Exponent*, e.g. expressing 4 × 4 × 4 as 43 , but

* gets stuck again at *Part 2: Evaluating an Exponential Expression*, e.g. computing (–4)3 \= (–4) × (–4) × (–4).


In this situation, the student has demonstrated that they understand the concept of an exponent, but they are struggling to use multiplication to compute the result.

Although multiplication occurs several steps back in the sequence of prerequisites, we have linked *Part 2: Evaluating an Exponential Expression* to the key prerequisite topic *Multiplying Negative Numbers*, which allows us to automatically trigger a targeted remedial review on *Multiplying Negative Numbers*.

![][image13]

##### \> Encompassings Enable Turbo-Boosted Learning Speed {#>-encompassings-enable-turbo-boosted-learning-speed}

Our knowledge graph also stores **encompassing** relationships between topics. Advanced mathematical problems implicitly practice or “encompass” many simpler skills. Using sophisticated algorithms that capitalize on these encompassings, Math Academy enables students to spend most of their time learning new material while simultaneously making sure they keep getting practice on things they’ve previously learned. This results in turbo-boosted learning speed.

How does this work? The main idea is that whenever a student is due to review some previously-learned material, we serve them the smallest possible set of learning tasks that encompasses all the due review. The student receives all the review they need, in the most concentrated form possible.

To illustrate, consider the following multiplication problem, in which we multiply the two-digit number 39 by the one-digit number 6:

![][image14]

In order to perform the multiplication above, we have to multiply one-digit numbers and add a one-digit number to a two-digit number:

* First, we multiply 6 × 9 \= 54\. We carry the 5 and write the 4 at the bottom.

* Then, we multiply 6 × 3 \= 18 and add 18 \+ 5 \= 23\. We write 23 at the bottom.

In other words, *Multiplying a Two-Digit Number by a One-Digit Number* **encompasses** *Multiplying One-Digit Numbers* and *Adding a One-Digit Number to a Two-Digit Number*.

We can visualize this using an **encompassing graph** as shown below. The encompassing graph is similar to a prerequisite graph, except the arrows indicate that a simpler topic is encompassed by a more advanced topic. (Encompassed topics are usually prerequisites, but prerequisites are often not fully encompassed.)

![][image15]

Now, suppose that a student is due for reviews on all three of these topics. Because of the encompassings, the only review that they will actually have to do is *Multiplying a Two-Digit Number by a One-Digit Number*. When they complete this review, it will implicitly provide repetitions on the topics that it encompasses because the student has effectively practiced those skills as well.

#### | Diagnostic Exams {#|-diagnostic-exams}

When a student joins Math Academy, they take an adaptive diagnostic exam that leverages the knowledge graph to quickly identify their **knowledge frontier**. The knowledge frontier is the boundary between what they know and what they don’t know, and it indicates what topics they are ready to learn. Following the diagnostic, whenever a student is served new lessons, those lessons always cover topics that are on the student’s knowledge frontier.

In addition to assessing knowledge of course content, our diagnostic exams also assess knowledge of lower-grade **foundations** that students need to know in order to succeed in the course (i.e. they are prerequisites for the course). It is common for incoming students to be excited about a course but lack some foundational knowledge – and our knowledge graph enables us to identify and fill in any missing foundational knowledge while simultaneously allowing students to learn course topics that don’t rely on that missing foundational knowledge.

## Chapter 5\. Accountability and Incentives {#chapter-5.-accountability-and-incentives}

***Summary:** Students and teachers are often not aligned with the goal of maximizing learning, which means that in the absence of accountability and incentives, classrooms are pulled towards a state of mediocrity. Accountability and incentives are typically absent in education, which leads to a “tragedy of the commons” situation where students pass courses (often with high grades) despite severely lacking knowledge of the content. However, Math Academy is properly held accountable and incentivized to maximize student learning.*

### Accountability and Incentives are Necessary but Absent in Education {#accountability-and-incentives-are-necessary-but-absent-in-education}

[According to](https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice\(PsychologicalReview\).pdf) K. Anders Ericsson (1993, with Krampe & Tesch-Romer), one of the most influential researchers in the field of human expertise and performance:

*“...\[D\]eliberate practice requires effort and is not inherently enjoyable. Individuals are motivated to practice because practice improves performance.”*

In other words, maximal learning does not happen naturally as a result of maximizing other things like enjoyment, comfort, convenience, and ease of practice. In fact, maximal learning is at odds with some of these things. Sacrifices must be made.

At the risk of stating the obvious: if you want to maximize learning, then you should not make decisions on the basis of anything other than how those decisions affect measurable learning. However, what may not be so obvious is that students and teachers are often not aligned with the goal of maximizing learning.

Students often just want to get a good enough grade to avoid angering their parents, or to get into college (or get a scholarship to college) – and in college, they often just want to do well enough to get their degree and either get a job or be accepted to graduate school. From the perspective of such students, the goal is to earn grades that are good enough to keep moving along their desired career path, while minimizing the amount of extra effort. Earning sufficient grades with minimal effort is totally different from maximizing learning.

Likewise, while teachers generally want their students to learn, they also receive substantial pressure from parents and administrators to make the learning process feel comfortable and enjoyable, and check boxes on people’s intuitions (however mistaken) about learning, while simultaneously ensuring that students don’t fall behind on any standardized tests. A teacher’s goal is often for their students to perform well enough not to raise eyebrows from parents and administrators, while minimizing the amount of griping from students (and parents) about how much effort is required.

These forces pull classrooms towards a state of mediocrity: students need to learn some baseline amount that is deemed “enough” for their grade level, but there is no need to learn more than that, even if it is possible (and extremely advantageous) to learn much more in the same amount of time.

The pull towards mediocrity is not unique to education. However, other industries do a better job of *counteracting* it by leveraging accountability mechanisms and incentives to motivate people to maximize performance. For instance, in professional athletics, coaches are held accountable for winning (their continued employment depends on it) and they are often incentivized with massive financial bonuses for achievements like qualifying for tournaments and winning championships. The same is true for players. Along the chain of command from team owners to coaches to players, there is also a chain of accountability and incentives.

While it’s true that college rankings can be viewed as some kind of incentive structure, it’s important to realize that learning is not the basis of such rankings. The rankings may incentivize other things, but not learning. As MIT researchers [elaborate](https://cbmm.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/CBMM%20Memo%20068-On%20Forgetting%20-%20June%2018th%202017%20v2.pdf) (Subirana, Bagiati, & Sarma, 2017):

*“Taking a look at major University ranking methodologies one can easily observe they consistently lack any objective measure of what content knowledge and skills students retain from college education in the long term.*  
*…*  
*In general, college academics taught in the classroom don’t seem to be recognized explicitly by public market indicators. As an example, MIT was ranked number one in the world by US News Report in the latest ranking available, however taking a closer look at the ranking methodology one can see it does not include any metric of what students retained from the classroom. In fact, all major market ranking methodologies consistently lack any objective measure of student college academic retention (\[MIT office of the provost 2012\]).”*

Likewise, while it’s true that teacher credentialing can be viewed as some sort of accountability mechanism, it’s important to realize that accountability for *learning* in particular is lacking. As discussed in [chapter 2](#bookmark=id.cyfxx290tej7), most teacher credentialing programs do not cover, much less assess, prospective teachers on their knowledge of the science of learning and ability to leverage effective practice techniques to maximize student learning.

It’s also worth noting that university professors generally aren’t required to earn teaching credentials, and they’re not even incentivized to teach as their primary concern – they are primarily measured in terms of research output, not teaching. Yet, they are also given more autonomy in designing their courses, and as a result, college courses tend to be more instructor-centered than student-centered (as compared to K-12 courses). A typical university professor gives some lectures, assigns weekly problem sets, and then gives a mid-term and a final exam that are curved so that no matter how much learning did or did not occur, the result is always a normal distribution and a shrug.

We re-emphasize some quotes from [chapter 2](#bookmark=id.cyfxx290tej7):

*“A recent textbook analysis (Pomerance, Greenberg, & Walsh, 2016\) took the six key learning strategies from this report by Pashler and colleagues, and found that very few teacher-training textbooks cover any of these six principles – and none cover them all, suggesting that these strategies are not systematically making their way into the classroom.”* – [Weinstein, Madan, & Sumeracki (2018)](https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-017-0087-y)

*“The preparation of virtually every college teacher consists of in-depth study in an academic discipline: chemistry professors study advanced chemistry, historians study historical methods and periods, and so on. Very little, if any, of our formal training addresses topics like adult learning, memory, or transfer of learning. … \[I\]ronically (and embarrassingly), it would be difficult to design an educational model that is more at odds with the findings of current research about human cognition than the one being used today at most colleges and universities.”* – [Halpern & Hakel (2003)](https://www.mensopschool.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/de-impact-van-lk-op-gemotiveerde-en-ongemotiveerde-lln.pdf)

### What Happens in the Absence of Accountability and Incentives {#what-happens-in-the-absence-of-accountability-and-incentives}

#### | Tragedy of the Commons {#|-tragedy-of-the-commons}

As discussed in [chapter 1](#bookmark=id.8h7zjznwystt), Bloom & Sosniak (1981) [noted](https://files.ascd.org/staticfiles/ascd/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_198111_bloom.pdf) that teachers typically focus on a “cross section” of many students covering a small subset of curriculum over a short period of time.

*"Although the curriculum in a particular subject may extend over a period of ten or more years, each teacher has the child only for a term, year, or course. And the teacher is responsible only for what happens during that period of time."*

As a result, maintenance and improvement of students’ mathematical knowledge is a responsibility shared by a group of many teachers.

However, it is widely known that in the absence of accountability and incentives that promote collective interests, people will focus on behaviors that benefit themselves as individuals, and pay less attention to how their actions affect the group as a whole. As a result, when a group is given responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of a shared resource, the resource will typically deteriorate. While some individuals may care for the resource properly, they are typically unable or unwilling to pick up the slack of those who do not. This kind of deterioration of a shared or “common” resource is known as the [**tragedy of the commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

A concrete example of the tragedy of the commons is littering. In the absence of accountability and incentives, public spaces will become filled with trash. Even people who dispose of their trash properly will generally not be motivated to pick up the trash of others. To prevent a public space from becoming filled with trash, it is necessary to create accountability mechanisms, such as fines for littering, and incentives, such as paid jobs to incentivize some people to periodically clean the space. But if the accountability and incentives are not implemented properly (e.g. the fine for littering is too low or unenforceable, or the paid jobs do not hire enough people or do not hold them accountable for actually cleaning the entire space), then the space will still become filled with trash.

The tragedy of the commons takes place in education in a similar way. Instead of “littering,” the tragic action is allowing students to pass courses despite severely lacking knowledge of the content. A teacher who “picks up other people’s trash” is a teacher who holds students accountable for learning the material in their course, including any prerequisite material that they are missing.

When there is a lot of “trash,” i.e. students are severely lacking prerequisite knowledge, a teacher who “picks up other people’s trash” puts forth a ton of effort supporting students through remedial assignments/assessments and help sessions, while simultaneously holding the line on expectations and enduring griping from students who experience a rude awakening about how much extra work they have to put in to shore up their missing foundations. Few teachers do this, just as few people pick up other people’s trash. Instead, when faced with a situation like this, the typical teacher will just run the class as usual, curve (or otherwise inflate) the grades, and leave the problem for the next year’s teacher to deal with (or not deal with).

While littering fines and paid janitorial jobs often provide the necessary accountability and incentives to keep spaces clean, teachers typically do not face penalties for allowing students to pass courses despite severely lacking knowledge of the content, and teachers are given no financial incentive for working hard to remedy these kinds of problematic situations that are created by other teachers. As a result, it is common for students to pass courses despite severely lacking knowledge of the content.

#### | Grades Can’t Be Trusted {#|-grades-can’t-be-trusted}

##### \> Evidence for Grade Inflation {#>-evidence-for-grade-inflation}

One of the most obvious examples of students passing courses (often with high grades) despite severely lacking knowledge of the content is the co-occurrence of extreme learning loss and extreme grade inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Researchers have [found](https://edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai22-521.pdf) that the learning loss experienced by students during COVID-19 was even more extreme than that experienced by evacuees during Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest hurricanes to hit the United States (Kuhfeld, Soland, & Lewis, 2022):

*“Using test scores from 5.4 million U.S. students in grades 3-8, we tracked changes in math and reading achievement across the first two years of the pandemic. Average fall 2021 math test scores in grades 3-8 were .20-27 standard deviations (SDs) lower relative to same-grade peers in fall 2019 … These drops are significantly larger than estimated impacts from other large school disruptions, such as after Hurricane Katrina (Sacerdote \[2012\] when reported math scores dropped .17 SDs in one year for New Orleans evacuees).”*

Based on the magnitude of this learning loss, one would reasonably expect that student grades would have dropped during the pandemic. But instead, the opposite happened: grades skyrocketed and remained elevated even after most schools returned to normal in-person instruction after the pandemic. As researchers at the CALDER Center (Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research) [discovered](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20Brief%2035-1123.pdf) when analyzing educational data from the state of Washington (Goldhaber & Young, 2023): 

*“...\[A\]lmost no students received an F grade in the spring of 2020\. The share of F grades dropped from … 9.3% to 1.4% in math courses … between the fall and spring semesters of 2020\. The distribution of grades higher than F mostly increased for A grades, with the share of A’s jumping from 32.9% to 56.3% in math … The average GPA in math jumped from 2.6 to 3.2 … The figures also suggest that English and science grades largely returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2021-22, but math grades did not. Indeed, the math GPA in 2021-22 was 2.7, 0.4 points higher than it was in 2018-19.”*

![][image19]

![][image20]

![][image21]

*Figures reproduced from Goldhaber & Young (2023) with permission.*

However, standardized test scores have not increased commensurately:

*“To better understand what these shifts in grading might mean, we perform some simple regressions to descriptively assess the extent to which the relationship between grades and test scores has changed over time. … \[A\] student who got an ‘A’ in Algebra 1 was predicted to be in the 73rd percentile of the test distribution in 2015-16, the 68th percentile in 2018-19, and the 58th percentile in 2021-22.”*

This phenomenon is not limited to the United States. It is widespread. For instance, a similar situation is [described](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Doz/publication/357457647_Students'_Mathematics_Achievements_A_Comparison_between_Pre-and_Post-COVID-19_Pandemic/links/61cefe48e669ee0f5c787faf/Students-Mathematics-Achievements-A-Comparison-between-Pre-and-Post-COVID-19-Pandemic.pdf) in an analysis of student grades in Italy (Doz, 2021):

*“...\[T\]he results showed a statistically significant difference in pre- and post-COVID-19 quarantine grades. End-of-year grades were higher than those before the COVID-19 confinement. Furthermore, the results indicated that more than half of the students in the sample achieved a higher grade at the end of the school year. … The findings suggest that greater caution should be paid in interpreting students’ grades pre- and post-COVID-19 confinement, since it cannot be excluded that such students’ achievements are inflated. Excessively high students’ grades that do not represent their actual knowledge and competencies could give educators and legislators misleading and even false information about the quality of distance learning and students’ knowledge.”*

Indeed, grade inflation has been happening for a while, that is, COVID-19 amplified an existing trend. As researchers from ACT, Inc. [describe](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED621326.pdf), high school grade point averages (HSGPA) have increased while standardized test scores – not just aptitude-oriented tests like the SAT, but also achievement-oriented tests like the ACT, the NAEP, and even end-of-course exams – have not (Sanchez & Moore, 2022).

*“...\[A\] mismatch between HSGPA and test scores suggests grade inflation is most likely present. HSGPA across time has been compared to ACT® (Bejar & Blew, 1981; Bellott, 1981\) and SAT scores (Godfrey, 2011), NAEP data (U.S. Department of Education, National Assessment of Educational Progress \[NAEP\], Long-Term Trend Reading Assessments, 2020), and end-of-course exams (Gershenson, 2018). Consistently, analyses have shown that HSGPA has steadily increased over the last several decades, but standardized assessment scores have remained stagnant or have fallen (Bejar & Blew, 1981; Gershenson, 2020).”*

As [elaborated](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED598893.pdf) by Gershenson (2018):

*“...\[R\]ising high school grade point averages (GPAs) have been accompanied by stagnant SAT, ACT, and NAEP scores, strongly suggesting lowered classroom standards. And in higher education, As are now the most common grade awarded, despite constituting just 15 percent of grades in the early 1960s.”*

*“While many students are awarded good grades, few earn top marks on the statewide end-of-course exams for those classes. … In fact, more than one-third of the students who received Bs from their teachers in Algebra 1 failed to score ‘proficient’ on the EOC exam.”*

*“...\[E\]arning a good grade in a course is no guarantee that a student has learned what the state expects her to have learned in that course. Results show that even students who earn the best grades often fail to demonstrate mastery of key skills and knowledge when measured on the state test. Recall that just 21 percent of A students and 3 percent of B students attain the ‘superior’ designation on the EOC, and more than one-third of B students don’t reach proficiency at all.”*

##### \> Why Grade Inflation is a Problem {#>-why-grade-inflation-is-a-problem}

Gershenson (2018) mentions that grade inflation can create a “vicious cycle” of students being set up for failure in future courses:

*“That’s clearly a problem since receiving an A or B in a course signals academic success to most students and their families. When students earn passing grades despite not mastering the academic material, a vicious cycle can follow, whereby they’re set up for failure via unmerited promotion to the next course or grade level.”*

*“...\[G\]rade inflation results in promoting students to subsequent grades and later accepting them to postsecondary institutions for which they are academically ill-prepared. Consequently, they struggle and risk dropping out.*  
*…*  
*\[G\]rade inflation may have the political consequence of encouraging families to believe everything is going well at school, even when a school is troubled and needs reform. It is easy for parents to ignore systemic mediocrity when their children’s grades seem strong.”*

This concern is [echoed](https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20Brief%2035-1123.pdf) by the Goldhaber & Young (2023):

*“Public opinion surveys point to a discrepancy between what parents believe about their student’s level of achievement, i.e., that students have recovered academically, and what test results like NAEP suggest about their achievement (Esquivel, 2022; Kane & Reardon, 2023; Vázquez Tonnes, 2023).*  
*…*  
*Algebra 1 – the course for which we noted the greatest weakening in the relationship between test scores and grades – is seen as a gateway to more advanced math concepts (Snipes & Finkelstein, 2015). … Schools use grades in classes such as Algebra 1 to determine whether students need extra support, remediation, or even if they must repeat a course before moving on. If this signal is no longer accurately conveying a student’s level of achievement, school systems risk under-supporting students who need help.*

*Likewise, families and students use grades as a signal of how a student is doing in school; the expectation is that if a student is having academic trouble, that trouble will show up in their grades. Decisions such as whether to enroll a child in after school tutoring or summer school may rest on a belief that the grades on a report card accurately reflect a student’s levels of achievement. As we noted above, many parents are under the impression that their children are not suffering from learning loss due to the pandemic; however, test scores indicate otherwise. It is possible that without a grade that signals trouble, parents may not choose to get needed extra academic support.”*

In short, parents typically think that an “A” indicates mastery of grade-level standards, but it often doesn’t. If a student’s school says that they’re doing fine in math, then it does not automatically follow that the student is keeping college and career doors open that depend on mathematical proficiency. Different schools sometimes have their own interpretations of what it means for their students to be doing fine in math, and that doesn’t always match up with grade-level standards, much less what is expected by colleges and careers.

This is a problem because it sets students up for failure later in life when it matters most. Every year, countless first-year college students decide to major in aerospace engineering or astrophysics or some other math-heavy subject, only to have that dream crushed when they realize they can’t even pass an entry-level math course like Calc II (not even with the help of a tutor). These problems can be remedied when students are young, before their knowledge deficits grow too large – but problems can only be fixed after they are detected, and grades are no longer a reliable tool for detecting these problems. Inflated grades signal to students and parents that all career doors remain open, when in fact, many are in the process of being locked shut.

#### | Resistance to Objective Measurement {#|-resistance-to-objective-measurement}

##### \> Radical Constructivism Rejects the Idea of Measuring Learning Objectively {#>-radical-constructivism-rejects-the-idea-of-measuring-learning-objectively}

As discussed above, there is overwhelming evidence that grades have increased while standardized test scores have not. However, because remedying grade inflation and its downstream effects requires lots of extra effort from all parties involved (including teachers, students, parents, administrators), there is opposing pressure to reject the idea that grade inflation is occurring. Given the evidence, the only way to argue against the existence of grade inflation is to argue against the very idea of measuring learning objectively.

As prominent psychologists John Anderson, Lynne Reder, and Herbert Simon [describe](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/reder/publications/98_jra_lmr_has.pdf) (1998), this is indeed a tenet of an educational philosophy known as [**radical constructivism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_constructivism):

*“The denial of the possibility of objective evaluation is perhaps the most radical and far-reaching of the constructivist claims. … D. Charney documents that empiricism has become a four-letter word in deconstructionist writings. D. H. Jonassen describes the issue from the perspective of a radical constructivist:*

*‘If you believe, as radical constructivists do, that no objective reality is uniformly interpretable by all learners, then assessing the acquisition of such a reality is not possible.’”*

[Take it from](https://app.nova.edu/toolbox/instructionalproducts/ITDE_8005/weeklys/1984-vonGlaserfeld_RadicalConstructivism.pdf) Ernst von Glasersfeld (1984) himself, who is widely regarded as the philosopher who first formulated radical constructivism:

*“Radical constructivism, thus, is radical because it breaks with convention and develops a theory of knowledge in which knowledge does not reflect an ‘objective’ ontological reality, but exclusively an ordering and organization of a world constituted by our experience.”*

To concretely understand the radical constructivist position in the context of grade inflation, recall that in the absence of accountability and incentives, public spaces will become filled with trash. Logically, the existence of excessive trash in a public space provides an argument for increasing accountability and incentives surrounding littering and janitorial work. However, a radical constructivist will resist this conclusion on the grounds that “one person’s trash is another person’s treasure” and therefore it is impossible to objectively measure the amount of trash on the ground.

Clearly, this counterargument is ridiculous and nobody would actually espouse it in the context of trash. People who enter a space can see, and agree, about how much trash is on the ground. However, the counterargument persists in the context of education because “seeing the trash for oneself” often requires a combination of expertise in the subject matter – which most people do not have, especially in the context of mathematics. And even those who do see the trash often turn a blind eye to it out of convenience because they don’t want to put in the extra effort to fix the situation, especially when their efforts will be met with griping from others who do not see the trash.

As Anderson, Reder, and Simon (1998) [elaborate](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/reder/publications/98_jra_lmr_has.pdf), the radical constructivists’ rejection of objective reality leads to other problematic conclusions:

*“Another sign of the radical constructivists’ discomfort with evaluation manifests itself in the motto that the teacher is the novice and the student the expert. The idea is that every student gathers equal value from every learning experience. The teacher’s task is to come to understand and value what the student has learned. As J. Confrey writes:*

*‘Seldom are students’ responses careless or capricious. We must seek out their systematic qualities which are typically grounded in the conceptions of the student. … \[F\]requently when students’ responses deviate from our expectations, they possess the seeds of alternative approaches which can be compelling, historically supported and legitimate if we are willing to challenge our own assumptions.’*

*Or, as Cobb, Wood, and Yackel write:*

*‘The approach respects that students are the best judges of what they find problematical and encourages them to construct solutions that they find acceptable given their current ways of knowing.’*

*If the student is supposed to move, in the course of the learning experiences, from a lower to a higher level of competence, why are the student’s judgments of the acceptability of solutions considered valid? While the teacher is valued who can appreciate children’s individuality, see their insights, and motivate them to do their best and to value learning, definite educational goals must be set. More generally, if the ‘student as judge’ attitude were to dominate education, when instruction had failed and when it had succeeded, when it was moving forward and when backward, would no longer be clear.*

*Understanding why the student, at a particular stage, is doing what he or she is doing is one thing. Helping the student understand how to move from processes that are ‘satisfactory’ in a limited range of tasks to processes that are more effective over a wider range is another matter. As L. B. Resnick argues, many concepts that children naturally come to (for example, that motion implies force) are not what the culture expects of education and in these cases ‘education must follow a different path: still constructivist in the sense that simple telling will not work, but much less dependent on untutored discovery and exploration.’”*

##### \> Radical Constructivism is a Present Force in Education {#>-radical-constructivism-is-a-present-force-in-education}

Radical constructivism might seem so outlandish that it is hard to imagine anyone seriously supporting it. However, it is indeed a present force in education. For instance, one document that circulated among educators during the 2021-22 school year (the year that most schools returned to in-person instruction after the COVID-19 pandemic) is [*Where Is Manuel? A Rejection of ‘Learning Loss’*](https://www.todos-math.org/assets/images/Where%20Is%20Manuel_.pdf), which, in a refusal to accept the reality that some demographics were more affected by pandemic-induced learning losses than others, outright rejects the idea that learning loss occurred during the pandemic.

The document makes a number of outlandish claims, some of are factually incorrect, and others of which are so vague that they can neither be proven or falsified (which effectively renders them meaningless):

*“It is important to note that we believe that learning takes place everywhere and always. … Funding and attention to ‘fix learning loss’ disregards our essential and suggested actions \[to move toward antiracist mathematics education for all students\].*  
*…*  
*This farce embodies the assumption that learning didn’t happen, or that it didn’t happen enough. This assumption is an insult to educators and families alike. … When teachers could not connect, students continued their learning and growing with and within their families and communities. Some of this learning was closely matched to traditional school standards, and some of this learning was not as aligned to school standards but went deeper and was more authentic than anything that could have been learned through a computer screen or even in a school building. This learning may be different, but it is not any less important and should not be treated as if it is wrong or insufficient.*

*Let’s revisit Manuel. With persistence, the educators would have discovered that Manuel’s days away from class were rich with learning experiences. Instead of attending class remotely, he went with his father to work and helped with his younger siblings and animals on the family farm. … Manuel and his siblings did some work assigned by their teachers, but they were more motivated and engaged in the learning that was acquired outside of school. Manuel has not lost learning. The flexibility of remote learning has allowed him to supplement his studies from school with a rich mathematical understanding of the world.*  
*…*  
*Resist the thinking that students like Manuel are behind, and instead remind yourself that they are right where they should be after a pandemic. Resist deficit thinking and do not send deficit messages to the students like Manuel, and others who did attend daily, and instead look for what knowledge they gained and how they grew. … Resist making the assumption that the learning students like Manuel experienced was not enough, and instead assume their experiences contributed to their present and future success in ways that are just as good, if not better, than what could have been learned through school.”*

The organization producing this document, [TODOS: Mathematics for ALL](https://www.todos-math.org/), is not just a fringe group. Between 2020-23, its leadership has included members of the Riverside and Santa Clara County Offices of Education and as well as professors from numerous universities including UCLA, UT Austin, The Ohio State University, University of Arizona, San Francisco University, University of Alberta, University of Missouri, Iowa State University, East Carolina University, University of New Mexico, Texas State University, and Utah Valley University. Furthermore, TODOS is a member of the [Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_Board_of_the_Mathematical_Sciences), which means that it is recognized by the [International Mathematical Union (IMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Union) as one of the 19 national mathematical societies for the United States. For reference, IMU awards some of the highest honors in the mathematical profession, including the Fields Medal, which is widely considered to be the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize.

TODOS has released numerous other documents espousing similar viewpoints. For instance, in [*The Mo(ve)ment to Prioritize Antiracist Mathematics: Planning for This and Every School Year*](https://www.todos-math.org/assets/images/The%20Movement%20to%20Prioritize%20Antiracist%20Mathematics%20final%203.0_v6.pdf) (2020), released shortly before *Where is Manuel*, TODOS stated the following:

*“Following school closure due to COVID-19, we have noted a resurgence of deficit views of students when they are described as ‘behind’ or ‘unable to catch up since they missed so much school.’ We believe this description of students is harmful. It frames students as individually responsible for a loss of learning and detracts from the broader issues of students and families surviving through a pandemic. Mathematics learning is a messy web of interconnected concepts. So we assert that instead of being distracted by framing students as lacking skills, we use the fall to start anew from an asset-based perspective. We urge policymakers, school district administrators, teachers, curriculum developers, and software developers to avoid playing into the fear-inciting discourses of students falling behind and ranking them by perceived ability.*

*To take it a step further, in this moment we must rethink what counts as valid mathematical knowledge. …  \[W\]e must expand our understanding of what it means to be good at mathematics, make space for alternative ways of knowing and doing mathematics based in the community, and acknowledge the brilliance, both in mathematics and beyond, of BIPOC \[Black, Indigenous, and People of Color\] in our classrooms.”*

Likewise, in the joint [position statement](https://www.todos-math.org/assets/docs2016/2016Enews/3.pospaper16_wtodos_8pp.pdf) between TODOS and the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM) from 2016:

*“...\[Deficit views of historically marginalized children can arise from\] the continuous labeling of children’s readiness to learn mathematics via standardized tests and other institutional tools that position and sanction specific forms of mathematics knowledge. … A social justice priority in mathematics education is to openly challenge deficit thinking and the institutional tools and practices that perpetuate static views about children and their mathematics competencies.*

*Second, deficit thinking implies that students “lack” knowledge and experiences expected by the dominant group. Deficit thinking ignores, dismisses, or casts as barriers mathematical knowledge and experiences children engage with outside of school every day. A social justice approach to mathematics education assumes students bring knowledge and experiences from their homes and communities that can be leveraged as resources for mathematics teaching and learning (Civil, 2007; Gonzalez et al., 2005; Leonard & Martin, 2013; Turner et al., 2012).*

*Mathematics achievement, often measured by standardized tests, has been used as a gatekeeping tool to sort and rank students by race, class, and gender starting in elementary school (Davis & Martin, 2008; Ellis, 2008; Spielhagen, 2011).”*

Note that while we have discussed radical constructivism at a high level in this chapter, our general critique cuts deeper and will continue in [chapter 8](#bookmark=id.hzqmmfd5p3yu), where we emphasize that effective practice requires direct instruction as opposed to unguided instruction.

### Math Academy is Held Accountable for Student Learning {#math-academy-is-held-accountable-for-student-learning}

Math Academy’s existence depends on its ability to make students learn. If a student gets stuck and can’t make progress in our system, then we’re out of a job. If the learning on our system doesn’t show up in students’ grades and test scores outside of our system, then we’re out of a job. We are properly incentivized to maximize student learning – real learning, not just the perception of it.

For this reason, we have no choice but to hold the line on what it means to truly learn something. When a student learns a topic on our system, they have to demonstrate that they really understand it. They have to solve real problems – successfully – and not just the simplest cases.

Perhaps surprisingly, this turns out to be one of our competitive advantages: we hold students accountable for learning, and they hold us accountable for providing material that is easy to learn from. More generally, we hold our users accountable for getting value out of our product, and our users hold us accountable for creating a valuable product.

This differentiates us from other free and ultra-low-cost online learning platforms whose dependence on a massive user base forces them to employ ineffective learning strategies that do not repel unserious students. Such platforms often cover only the simplest cases of each topic, and allow students to move on to more advanced topics despite poor performance on prerequisite topics. They are like teachers who go through the motions and check boxes, whereas Math Academy is like a tutor whose livelihood depends on the actual learning outcomes of its students.

It also differentiates us from typical university courses where the professor can dump a mountain of topics onto a syllabus, provide a few handwavy lectures along with a list of references to outside resources, and then grade on a curve. We have to actually construct a learning path that offers a high probability of success for anyone willing to run through the gates.

Granted, we do sometimes have to deliver unfortunate news to incoming students and their parents who mistakenly believe, on the basis of their good grades, that they are comprehensively proficient in the mathematical subjects that they have taken at school. We can’t promise that students and parents will be happy with their diagnostic results. It’s not uncommon for our diagnostic test to expose that a student needs to relearn some things that they supposedly “already know” (but don’t actually know) from school. But we can promise that, if our diagnostic test reveals any gaps in a student’s knowledge, then we will automatically add those gaps to their learning plan to get them back on track.

  ***Importance:** Deliberate practice requires effort and is not inherently enjoyable. Individuals are motivated to practice because practice improves performance. In other words, maximal learning does not happen naturally as a result of maximizing other things like enjoyment, comfort, convenience, and ease of practice. In fact, maximal learning is at odds with some of these things. Sacrifices must be made.*

  ***Importance:** While it’s true that college rankings can be viewed as some kind of incentive structure, it’s learning is not the basis of such rankings. Major university ranking methodologies consistently lack any objective measure of what content knowledge and skills students retain from college education in the long term. The rankings may incentivize other things, but not learning.*

  ***Importance:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, grades skyrocketed and remained elevated even after most schools returned to normal in-person instruction after the pandemic. This is a widespread phenomenon occurring beyond the United States. Grade inflation prevents learning issues from being detected, and schools and families risk under-supporting students who need help.*

  ***Importance:** Grade inflation has been happening for a while. High school grade point averages (HSGPA) have increased while standardized test scores – not just aptitude-oriented tests like the SAT, but also achievement-oriented tests like the ACT, the NAEP, and even end-of-course exams – have not. Grade inflation can create a “vicious cycle” of students being set up for failure in future courses.*

  ***Importance:** Given the evidence, the only way to argue against the existence of grade inflation is to argue against the very idea of measuring learning objectively. Indeed, this outlandish position is taken by proponents of the radical constructivist philosophy of education, such as TODOS: Mathematics for ALL.*
