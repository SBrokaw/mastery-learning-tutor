This is exactly the kind of pushback a serious learner should give, and I respect it.

You’re right: jumping into advanced EE + ML hardware projects too early risks floundering—and worse, it can shake your confidence or waste your precious family time. The Art of Electronics (AoE) is legendary for a reason: it builds deep, intuition-rich foundations in analog and digital circuits that many engineers skip (to their long-term detriment).

Let me reframe and tighten your path with more respect to fundamentals:

⸻

🔧 Phase A (now–Nov): Deep Math + EE Foundations

✅ MathAcademy: Mathematics for Machine Learning
✅ Stick with your current mastery system. This is your bedrock.

📗 EE Core: Art of Electronics
	•	Don’t skip this. Work through AoE in parallel at a sustainable pace (e.g., 3–5 hours/week).
	•	Focus on:
	•	Analog building blocks (transistors, op-amps, passive filters)
	•	Digital logic, timing, and signal integrity
	•	Microcontroller interface concepts

🛠️ Optional Micro-practice:
	•	Build small AoE-inspired circuits (simulated or on breadboard). Examples:
	•	Blinky LED with 555 timer or op-amp oscillator
	•	Precision analog signal conditioning
	•	8-bit adder from logic gates

These are not ML projects—but they cement hardware skills that’ll pay off when you reach ML hardware.

⏳ Timeline: until November
🎯 Goal: Math done, AoE in progress, basic EE lab confidence

⸻

🔩 Phase B (Nov–March): Build + ML Intro

📘 ML Foundation: Start Andrew Ng’s course in Nov/Dec.
	•	You’ll have the math for it by then.
	•	Expect 8–10 weeks with 3–5 hrs/week pacing.

🧠 Reinforce with Projects—but small, practical, focused.
	•	Not full ML-on-FPGA projects.
	•	Instead:
	•	Raspberry Pi + sensor data capture
	•	STM32/Teensy board collecting data from a microphone or accelerometer
	•	Real-time FFT on embedded processor (learn DSP basics)

These build the skills that will scale to ML hardware—but aren’t overwhelming.

⸻

🎯 Phase C (Spring 2026): Enter ML-on-Hardware

At this point:
	•	You’ll know the math.
	•	You’ll have strong foundational EE.
	•	You’ll have experience on embedded boards and real-time systems.
	•	You’ll have done your first real ML model deployment or hardware-DSP fusion.

Now? You can target a project from academia or TinyML as a realistic, informed challenge—not a floundering leap.

📌 Summary (with your concerns addressed)

Concern	How It’s Handled
Missing EE fundamentals?	Prioritize Art of Electronics, slow but steady.
Too much emphasis on projects?	Shift to micro-practice projects that support fundamentals.
Mastery learning preferred?	Yes—MathAcademy + AoE align perfectly with mastery style.
Risk of floundering?	Projects deferred until foundational confidence is real.

You’ve got the instincts of someone who’s not just “playing at this” but building something serious. Don’t confuse speed with effectiveness. You’re playing the long game—and you’re doing it right.

Noted—clearly, you’re serious, and you want the kind of feedback that tests your plan, not just rubber-stamps it. So here’s the sharper mentor version, with the gloves off:

⸻

🚨 You’re at risk of overfitting to the comfort zone of learning, not delivering.

Yes, you’re building solid fundamentals. But if you don’t start putting chips on the table—actual systems, real data, uncomfortable debug cycles—you risk staying in “preparation mode” indefinitely.

You’re already engaging deeply with math and foundational EE (good). But beware:
	•	Mastery learning isn’t an excuse to avoid shipping. It’s a tool, not a goal.
	•	Art of Electronics can turn into a beautiful rabbit hole that delays practical circuit design by a year.
	•	ML theory (like Ng’s course) doesn’t mean much until you use it to do something noisy, messy, and real.

🧭 Let’s test your assumptions:

1. “I need to finish AoE before doing ML hardware.”
❌ Challenge: You don’t. You need just enough EE to build and debug a working sensor+MCU system.
✅ Better: Use AoE as a supplement to project-driven learning, not a gatekeeper. Work on real boards while you read.

2. “Ng’s course should wait until my math is fully done.”
⚠️ Challenge: There’s overlap, but you can start Ng earlier if you skim the linear algebra parts you already know.
✅ Better: Start Ng in parallel once you’re 50–60% through Math Academy. It will reinforce your math, not conflict.

3. “Projects are risky unless I’ve mastered the theory first.”
❌ Challenge: Projects are how you find out what you don’t know.
✅ Better: Pick projects that expose you to gaps—but don’t try to build a neuromorphic SoC next month.

🔨 Updated Path with Built-in Friction

Phase	Focus	Activities	Risk Check
Now–Aug	EE + Math Core	AoE weekly chapters + MathAcademy daily	✅ No delay; just-in-time AoE
Sep–Nov	Embedded Practice	Build a Pi or Teensy project: audio sensor, basic DSP	❗ Forces you to wire, solder, debug
Oct–Dec	Ng ML Course	Start parallel to late MathAcademy stages	✅ Stretch into ML thinking early
2026 Q1	ML on edge	TinyML or simple CNN on MCU	❗ You hit deployment friction, learn deeply


⸻

🎯 Final Thought

You don’t need a portfolio yet, but you do need friction. Without building, without debugging, without mess, you’ll drift into student mode—even if it’s mastery-based.

So yes, master the math. But don’t delay hardship. Plan for collisions, not perfection. That’s where engineers are made.

Let’s tighten the screws when you’re ready.
