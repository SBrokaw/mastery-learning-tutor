## Description

This rule ensures effective task planning and progress tracking for the Mastery Learning Career Coach system. The system creates personalized learning tasks and tracks progress toward career transition goals, with a focus on optimizing time investment for maximum ROI.

## Rule

When managing tasks for the mastery learning tutor:

1. All new AI tasks MUST start with a review and update of the `tasks/ai/scratchpad.md` file
2. The scratchpad MUST be cleared of old task content before starting a new task
3. Each task MUST include:
   - Task description and requirements
   - Step-by-step plan with todo markers
   - Progress updates as steps are completed
   - Reflection points at key milestones
4. Todo markers MUST use the format `[ ]` for incomplete and `[X]` for complete items
5. The scratchpad MUST be referenced before starting any new subtask
6. All AI task files MUST be stored in the `tasks/ai/` directory

## AI Scratchpad Format

```markdown
# Current Task: [Task Name]

## Description
[Detailed task description and requirements]

## Plan
[ ] Step 1: Initial setup
[ ] Step 2: Core implementation
[ ] Step 3: Testing

## Progress
[X] Step 1 completed: Initial setup done
[ ] Step 2 in progress: Core implementation

## Reflections
### Milestone 1
- Accomplished: [List of achievements]
- Challenges: [List of issues encountered]
- Improvements: [List of potential improvements]
- Next Steps: [List of next actions]
```

## Human Task Structure

The `/tasks/human/` directory MUST be organized into three priority-based categories:

### 1. Validation Tasks (`validation/`)
- **Purpose**: Verify current learning state and career readiness
- **Priority**: HIGH - These tasks block further development
- **Requirements**: Self-assessment, skill validation, learning progress review
- **Naming**: `01-task-name.md`, `02-task-name.md`, etc.
- **Status Tracking**: Must include Not Started/In Progress/Complete/Blocked

### 2. Clarity Tasks (`clarity/`)
- **Purpose**: Support career transition with quantitative data and analysis
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhance transition effectiveness and communication
- **Requirements**: Market research, salary data, skill demand analysis
- **Naming**: `01-task-name.md`, `02-task-name.md`, etc.

### 3. Visual Tasks (`visual/`)
- **Purpose**: Create diagrams, charts, and visual aids for portfolio and communication
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Improve presentation and documentation
- **Requirements**: Portfolio visuals, skill mapping diagrams, progress charts
- **Naming**: `01-task-name.md`, `02-task-name.md`, etc.

## Human Task File Format

All human task files MUST follow the template structure:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Estimated Time: [X hours]
Dependencies: [List of requirements]
Status: [Not Started/In Progress/Complete/Blocked]

## Objective
[Clear description of the task goal and why it's important for career transition]

## Steps
1. [ ] Step one
2. [ ] Step two
3. [ ] Step three

## Data Collection
- Location: [Where to store data]
- Format: [Expected data format]
- Validation: [How to verify success]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Notes
[Any additional information, warnings, or special considerations]

## Progress Updates
### [Date] - [Duration]
- [ ] Step completed
- [ ] Data collected
- [ ] Issues encountered
- [ ] Next steps
```

## Human Task README Requirements

The `tasks/human/README.md` MUST include:

1. **Current Priorities Section** with:
   - High priority tasks listed first
   - Status, time estimates, and dependencies
   - Clear priority indicators (üî¥ HIGH, üü° MEDIUM, üü¢ LOW)

2. **Task Categories Section** explaining:
   - Purpose of each category (validation/clarity/visual)
   - Priority levels and dependencies
   - Typical requirements and outputs

3. **Getting Started Section** with:
   - How to check priorities
   - How to use templates
   - Where to store data
   - How to update status

4. **Status Legend** defining:
