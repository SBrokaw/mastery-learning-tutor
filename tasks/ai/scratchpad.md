# Current Task: Generate Optimized Learning Plan Based on Assessment

## Description
Create a personalized learning plan based on the user's assessment, focusing on NVIDIA-targeted skills: Mathematics, Python/CS basics, Python ML Foundational Models, and TinyML MIT Open Courseware, with EE gaps filled via The Art of Electronics.

## Plan
[X] Rewrite task-planning.mdc for mastery-learning-tutor project
[X] Update AI scratchpad with new focus
[X] Analyze user's current situation and goals
[X] User clarified: Power Integrity is a tangent, focus on NVIDIA path
[ ] Generate optimized learning plan with specific tasks
[ ] Create next high-priority task

## Progress
[X] Rewrote task-planning.mdc to focus on career transition and learning optimization
[X] Updated AI scratchpad to reflect new project focus
[X] Completed comprehensive learning state assessment
[X] User confirmed NVIDIA focus and rejected Power Integrity tangent
[ ] Next: Generate specific learning tasks for NVIDIA path

## Reflections
### Milestone: Strategic Clarity Achieved
- Accomplished: User rejected Power Integrity tangent, confirmed NVIDIA focus
- Challenges: Need to create specific tasks for Mathematics → Python → ML → TinyML path
- Improvements: Clear focus on highest-ROI skills for NVIDIA roles
- Next Steps: Generate detailed learning plan with specific tasks and timelines

## User Clarified Learning Path
- **Target Company**: NVIDIA
- **Core Path**: Mathematics → Python/CS basics → Python ML Foundational Models → TinyML MIT Open Courseware
- **EE Supplement**: The Art of Electronics for gaps
- **Rejected**: Power Integrity (confirmed as tangent)
- **Current Progress**: 24% through Math Academy Mathematics for Machine Learning

## User Context
- **Current Role**: Electrical Engineer in Marketing at Tektronix (8 years)
- **Goal**: Transition to ML Hardware Design or ML CS roles
- **Target**: $160k salary by next Summer
- **Time Constraint**: 1-2 hours per day
- **Learning Preference**: Math Academy mastery-based approach
