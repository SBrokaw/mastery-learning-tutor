# Task: NVIDIA Learning Path Validation
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Dependencies: Current Learning State Assessment (Complete)
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Validate and refine the NVIDIA-focused learning path by researching specific role requirements, skill priorities, and creating a detailed timeline for Mathematics → Python → ML → TinyML progression.

## Steps
1. [ ] Research specific NVIDIA ML Hardware roles and requirements
2. [ ] Identify which Math Academy modules are most relevant to NVIDIA roles
3. [ ] Map Python/CS basics to NVIDIA technical interview requirements
4. [ ] Research TinyML MIT Open Courseware content and prerequisites
5. [ ] Create timeline for completing each phase within 1-2 hours/day constraint
6. [ ] Identify specific portfolio projects that demonstrate NVIDIA-relevant skills

## Data Collection
- Location: data/learning/nvidia-path-validation.md
- Format: Role requirements, skill mapping, timeline, project ideas
- Validation: Cross-reference with NVIDIA job postings and employee backgrounds

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Specific NVIDIA roles identified with salary ranges
- [ ] Math Academy modules prioritized for NVIDIA relevance
- [ ] Python/CS learning plan created with specific resources
- [ ] TinyML course prerequisites and timeline mapped
- [ ] Portfolio project ideas that demonstrate NVIDIA-relevant skills
- [ ] Realistic timeline for $160k goal by Summer 2025

## Notes
This validation is critical because NVIDIA is highly competitive. We need to ensure every hour invested directly contributes to their hiring criteria. Focus on skills that differentiate you from pure CS candidates (your EE background is an advantage if properly positioned).
