# Task: Math Academy Progress Assessment
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 30 minutes
Dependencies: None
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Assess current progress through Math Academy's Mathematics for Machine Learning course to understand baseline knowledge and identify the next optimal learning steps for ML Hardware/CS transition.

## Steps
1. [ ] Review current Math Academy account and progress
2. [ ] Document completed modules and current position
3. [ ] Assess mastery level of completed topics
4. [ ] Identify knowledge gaps relevant to ML Hardware/CS
5. [ ] Determine next 2-3 modules to focus on

## Data Collection
- Location: data/learning/math-academy-assessment.md
- Format: Progress summary, mastery levels, next steps
- Validation: Self-assessment of understanding and confidence

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Current Math Academy progress documented
- [ ] Mastery level assessed for completed topics
- [ ] Knowledge gaps identified for ML Hardware/CS roles
- [ ] Next learning priorities established
- [ ] Time estimate for next modules calculated

## Notes
This assessment is critical for optimizing the 1-2 hours per day learning time. Focus on topics that directly contribute to ML Hardware/CS skills rather than general mathematics. Consider which topics will have the highest ROI for your career transition.
