# Task: Current Learning State Assessment
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 45 minutes
Dependencies: None
Status: Complete

## Objective
Comprehensive assessment of current learning state, skills, and career readiness to create an optimized learning path for ML Hardware/CS transition within the 1-2 hours per day constraint.

## Steps
1. [X] Assess current Math Academy progress and mastery level
Dedicated 167 hours to Math Academy since November 2024 and currently 24% through *Mathematics for Machine Learning*
2. [X] Inventory existing EE and marketing skills relevant to ML Hardware/CS
Launched two isolated power probes in the last 5 years. These probes at Tektronix focused mostly on the WBG semiconductor markets and SiC specifically. The latest probe also has uses in Power Integrity which I am now beginning to learn about. To be honest my knowledge in Power Integrity is very low but I have a good mentor in Steve Sandler at Picotest and have a learning plan from ChatGPT. But I don't know if Power Integrity is the best place for me to dedicate my time so I haven't started that learning plan yet. Here is the learning plan, for your reference:
You're not wrong to worry — power integrity (PI) is unforgiving to gaps in fundamentals. It's a multilayered stack: physics, circuits, modeling, measurement, and systems-level thinking, all colliding at high speed. But the good news is that a Math Academy–style, mastery-based, bottom-up approach can be applied. You just have to chart it carefully, because no one has packaged it that way (yet).

Here's a proposed structured roadmap tailored to your background and goals, split into five tiers. Each tier includes concepts, materials, and checkpoints.

⸻

You should be able to:
	•	Sketch and explain a Bode plot for an RLC filter
	•	Solve for Vout(s)/Vin(s) of a simple circuit
	•	Reason about resonance and damping qualitatively

⸻

Tier 1: Classic Power Delivery and Decoupling

	•	VRMs, LDOs, and regulator behavior
	•	Bulk vs ceramic capacitor selection
	•	Impedance vs frequency of a power rail
	•	Target impedance concept
	•	Plane resonance and anti-resonance

	•	Signal and Power Integrity – Simplified by Eric Bogatin (esp. Ch. 11–13)
	•	Picotest App Notes and Webinar Library (link)

Checkpoint:

You should be able to:
	•	Draw a target impedance mask
	•	Select decoupling caps to shape impedance vs frequency
	•	Simulate and interpret PDN impedance using SPICE or similar

⸻

Tier 2: Measurement Techniques in PI

Goal: Master how to measure what really matters, without lying to yourself.

Key Concepts:
	•	Oscilloscope probe loading and bandwidth
	•	Common-mode vs differential errors
	•	Measuring power rail ripple and transient droop
	•	VRM step load testing and sig gen emulation
	•	Use of VNAs to measure impedance

Materials:
	•	Power Integrity Characterization and Troubleshooting Techniques (Tek/Keysight app notes)
	•	Steve Sandler's lectures (e.g., DesignCon, SI Journal webinars)
	•	Join the SI-PI Slack or SI List forums to see real-world setups

Checkpoint:

You should be able to:
	•	Select the right probe chain for a power rail measurement
	•	Perform a load step test and interpret the results
	•	Measure VRM impedance using Bode plotter or VNA

⸻

Tier 3: High-Speed, AI-Class PI

Goal: Engage the unique demands of AI-scale systems — 1000+ A, <1V, GHz+ noise.

Key Concepts:
	•	PDN modeling as transmission line
	•	Power plane resonance
	•	Low ESL capacitors and via placement
	•	On-die and on-package decoupling
	•	Switched-mode converter noise and EMI
	•	3D EM field solvers and behavioral modeling

Materials:
	•	Principles of Power Integrity for PDN Design by Larry D. Smith and Eric Bogatin
	•	QuietPower columns by Steve Sandler
	•	IEEE papers from DesignCon and EPEPS (email me titles, I can summarize)

Checkpoint:

You should be able to:
	•	Analyze a high-speed PDN simulation and spot issues
	•	Propose fixes to plane resonance
	•	Justify tradeoffs in capacitor selection and placement under 1 nH constraints

⸻

Tier 4: Leading Edge — Co-Design, AI, ML Hardware

Goal: Apply PI in the context of emerging AI and ML hardware systems.

Key Concepts:
	•	PDN co-design with package, die, and board
	•	PI vs thermal vs EMI tradeoffs
	•	AI hardware power transient profiles
	•	Measurement uncertainty analysis (your paper)
	•	Simulation and measurement correlation

Materials:
	•	Open-source papers from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel on PDN and package co-design
	•	RAIL modeling guides from Keysight, Cadence, or ANSYS
	•	Application notes from Picotest and Tektronix (which you're already contributing to)

Checkpoint:

You should be able to:
	•	Explain why PI makes or breaks a new ML SoC
	•	Interpret ripple/droop on real transients in time and frequency
	•	Propose measurement chain improvements with quantifiable impact

⸻

Final Notes:
	•	Don't skip hands-on. Build a PDN test board or replicate known setups.
	•	Document as you go. You'll build a PI portfolio this way.
	•	Mastery learning = don't move on until your intuition is solid.
3. [X] Identify specific knowledge gaps for target roles
Fundamental CS skills like data structures, flow control, and operating systems info, Python for mathematics knowledge. Implementing foundational models in Python. Hardware ML projects like Tiny ML. Layout design, PCB design, CAD tools. 
4. [X] Evaluate current portfolio and project experience
Lots of little tasks for customers in my current role but never have to design a PCB or make a full integrated circuit. I build a lot of RC filters, connectors, do some simulations, collect s-parameters for probes and explain the frequency response and how it can affect time-domain measurements, etc. Deep understanding of test&measurement specifications like gain, aberrations, noise, etc.
5. [X] Assess networking and industry connections
most network is from Tektronix and in the Hillsboro and Beaverton, OR area. Some Portland, OR as well.
6. [X] Document time availability and learning preferences
At least one hour per night after girls' bedtime. And sometimes I can sneak an hour at work if it's a dual duty kind of task that is also useful for my job.
